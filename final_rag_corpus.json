If you do this you will be rewarded by eternal paradise in the Last\nDay. And if you don’t, you will be punished by Hellfire according to\nyour sins.\n[He] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving\"\nAl Mulk– No. 67 - Verse 2\n\"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.

He is eternal with no beginning or end. He is not born. He do not beget. He do not have a family or a wife or children. In short, your limited human mind can never encompass or comprehend His Divine Self, His wisdom or even His infinite powers.\nHe is beyond human senses, mind and imagination. Even the human language will fail to describe Him.\nSome Qur'anic verses explain these big facts:\n\"Say, \"He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent.\" Al Ikhlas– no. 112 – verse 1 – 4\n\"Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth.\nWho is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Highest, the Greatest.\"\nAl Baqarah– no.2 – verse 255\n\" [He is] Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you from yourselves, mates, and among the cattle, mates; He multiplies you thereby.

          "answer": "How do you want to see the creator with your eyes when you cannot see many of his creations with your eyes?\nExample 1: you cannot see your soul which gives life and movement to your body. It leaves your body every day when you sleep and comes back when you wake up. And this is happening everyday all through your life. And you or anyone else have never been able to see it or even recognize what it is made of or anything about it.\nExample 2: You cannot see very tiny beings like microbes or viruses. You need an expensive microscope that enlarges things thousands of times to be able to see them. These very tiny creatures are created by Allah, but we cannot see them with our naked eyes.\nExample 3: the Ultra-sonic waves cannot be heard by the human ears. And it is one of Allah's creations. So, how do you want to hear Allah the creator Himself?\nExample4: the sun is one of the creations of Allah. It is bigger than Earth approximately 1 million and 3 hundred thousand times. The temperature on its surface can reach tens of thousands of degrees Celsius. Try to look at the sun with your naked eyes at noon. You can never look more than a few seconds or you will lose your eyesight.\nSo, if you cannot understand, see or look at many of Allah's creations, for different reasons, how do you want to see the creator Himself?\nIt is very logical that we cannot see him.\n\"Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted.\"\nAl An'am– no.6 – verse 103\n\"And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \"My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You.\" [Allah] said, \"You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me.\" But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious.

And leave aside any prejudice or wrong information you may have been affected by through the media or any other source. Read it with your common sense and human logic and try to understand the divine logical messages that are very obvious in this book from beginning to end.

          "question": "Do you think that all these deities worshipped by people everywhere cannot offer any benefit or harm to the worshippers? But there are different gods with different names and stories.",
          "answer": "Yes, none of these deities can offer any real benefit or cause any harm to those who worship them, regardless of their different names, stories, or forms. This is because they are not true gods in the first place. They neither create nor control anything in existence; rather, they themselves are created and completely powerless.\n\nAllah clearly states this reality in the Qur'an:\n\n\"But they have taken besides Him gods which create nothing, while they are created, and possess not for themselves any harm or benefit and possess not [power to cause] death or life or resurrection.\"\nAl-Furqan – no. 25 – verse 3\n\nThis verse establishes a fundamental criterion for divinity: a true God must be the Creator, fully independent, and possessing absolute power over benefit, harm, life, death, and resurrection. Any being that lacks these attributes can never be worthy of worship.\n\nAs for the multiplicity of gods, names, and stories, Allah explains that these so-called deities are nothing more than human inventions passed down through generations without any divine proof:\n\n\"They are not but [mere] names you have named them – you and your forefathers – for which Allah has sent down no authority. They follow not except assumption and what [their] souls desire, and there has already come to them from their Lord guidance.\"\nAn-Najm – no. 53 – verse 23\n\nThus, the diversity of idols and gods does not indicate truth or power; rather, it reflects human desires, cultural traditions, and assumptions unsupported by revelation. True guidance comes only from Allah, the One Creator, who alone deserves worship.",

          "question": "And why did Allah create this entire universe, the heavens, the earth and all the creatures? Why did He create human beings if you were right?",
          "answer": "Allah created this entire universe, including the heavens, the earth, and all creatures, for a clear, wise, and purposeful reason. The creation was not random, meaningless, or for play. The primary purpose of creating human beings and jinn is clearly stated by Allah Himself:\n\n\"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me. I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed Me. Indeed, it is Allah who is the [continual] Provider, the firm possessor of strength.\"\nAdh-Dhariyat – no. 51 – verses 56–58\n\nThis verse establishes that worship is the core purpose of human existence. Allah does not need His creation in any way; He is completely self-sufficient. Worship benefits the human being, not Allah.\n\nIt is important to understand that the word \"worship\" does not mean only performing rituals such as prayer or fasting. Worship is a comprehensive and all-encompassing concept. It includes obeying Allah and His Messenger in every aspect of life, whether major or minor, outward or inward. It means living according to divine guidance in beliefs, actions, morals, and intentions.\n\nFurthermore, Allah clarifies that the universe itself was created with truth, wisdom, and a fixed purpose:\n\n\"We did not create the heavens and earth and what is between them except in truth and [for] a specified term. But those who disbelieve, from that of which they are warned, are turning away.\"\nAl-Ahqaf – no. 46 – verse 3\n\nThis confirms that creation has meaning, direction, and an appointed end. Those who deny this purpose turn away from the warning and guidance sent to them. Thus, human life is a test of worship, obedience, and recognition of the Creator, within a universe created with truth and wisdom.",

          "question": "But if God created the world and the human beings and everything in this universe, then; Who created God?",
          "answer": "Your question itself is illogical. It can never be asked because if you assume that God was created. So, there should be another creator? If I tell you that “W” for example created God, You will ask the same question: Who created “W”. If I tell you that “H” created “W”. You will reiterate the\nsame question: Who created “H”. And the same question will be asked forever. So, Logically, there must be one who started everything and all creatures. This one must be omnipotent and different from anything we know. It is a truism and a very logical assumption. This is our creator.\nSo, If the creator was started or created. Then He is not God. God can never be started or created like his creations.\nIf God was created, then, he would be similar to his creatures in their weaknesses. if Allah was created by something or someone, logically, he would be weak and under control from the one who created him. Consequently, He will not be suitable to be a God.\nAgain, you will ask: Okay, he is the creator, But how he started. Again, I answer: If he was created so he can never be God.\nBriefly:\nThinking about the Divine-self of the creator is beyond our limited mind. And it will surely lead to atheism. When Satan urges you to think about Allah's Divine self or what He look like or such questions remember this verse in Qur'an:\n\"There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.\"\nAsh-Shura– no. 42 – verse11\nAlso put this warning from prophet Muhammad into your consideration:\nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Satan comes to one of you and says, 'Who created so-and-so? 'till he says, 'Who has created your Lord?' So, when he inspires such a question, one should seek refuge with Allah and give up such thoughts.\"\nSahih al-Bukhari - Book 59, Hadith 85\nNote1: Always remember that you can know Allah from his creatures in this universe and from his innumerable creatures and blessings but not from thinking about his divine self which is beyond our minds. It is a very dangerous red-line. It will lead you to nothing. So, beware.\nVery briefly, when this question haunts you, say to yourself Automatically:\n\" Anything who is created is usually weak and limited. God or Allah can never be created or he will be controlled by the one who created him and will never be God\"",

People experience a kind of spiritual life in their graves based on their deeds in this life.\nThe following Hadeeths shed some light on this fact\nNarrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:\nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, When the funeral is ready and the men carry it on their shoulders, if the deceased was righteous it will say, 'Present me (hurriedly),' and if he was not righteous, it will say, 'Woe to it (me)! Where are they taking it (me)?' Its voice is heard by everything except man and if he heard it, he would fall unconscious.\" Sahih al-Bukhari 1314 - Book 23, Hadith 72\nChapter 70: What Has Been Related About the Punishment In The Grave\nAbu Hurairah narrated that:\nThe Messenger of Allah said: \"When the deceased - or he said when one of you - is buried, two angels, black and blue (eyed_ come to him. One of them is called Al-Munkar, and the other An-Nakir. They say: 'What did you use to say about this man?' So he says what he was saying (before death) 'He is Allah's slave and His Messenger. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.' So they say: 'We knew that you would say this.' Then his grave is expanded to seventy by seventy cubits, then it is illuminated for him. Then it is said to him: 'Sleep.' So he said: 'Can I return to my family to inform them?' They say: 'Sleep as a newlywed, whom none awakens but the dearest of his family.' Until Allah resurrects him from his resting place.\"If he was a hypocrite he would say: 'I heard people saying something, so I said the same; I do not know.' So they said: 'We knew you would say that.' So the earth is told: 'Constrict him.' So it constricts around him, squeezing his ribs together. He continues being punished like that until Allah resurrects him from his resting place.\"\nJami` at-Tirmidhi 1071- Book 10, Hadith 107\n\"And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on. And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, and the record [of deeds] will be placed, and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought, and it will be judged between them in truth, and they will\nnot be wronged.

          "question": "And can Allah really resurrect all the billions of people who died hundreds and thousands of years ago? They are billions of people whose bodies are worn out. Nothing is left from them. Can Allah really resurrect them again, evaluate their deeds and grant them eternal life in Paradise or Hellfire?",
          "answer": "Yes, Allah is absolutely able to resurrect all human beings, regardless of how long they have been dead or how much their bodies have decayed. The disintegration of bodies and the passage of time do not diminish Allah’s power in the slightest. The One who created human beings the first time from nothing is surely able to recreate them again.\n\nAllah directly addresses this doubt in the Qur'an, exposing the inconsistency of such thinking:\n\n\"Does man not consider that We created him from a [mere] sperm-drop – then at once he is a clear adversary? And he presents for Us an example and forgets his [own] creation. He says, 'Who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated?'\"\n\nAllah then gives the decisive answer:\n\n\"Say, 'He will give them life who produced them the first time; and He is, of all creation, Knowing.'\"\n\nAllah further illustrates His absolute power through signs that humans witness every day:\n\n\"[It is] He who made for you from the green tree, fire, and then from it you ignite. Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them? Yes, [it is so]; and He is the Knowing Creator. His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, 'Be,' and it is. So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned.\"\nYa-Sin – no. 36 – verses 77–83\n\nThese verses make it clear that resurrection is not difficult for Allah. Creating the heavens and the earth is far greater than recreating human beings, yet Allah accomplished it effortlessly. For Allah, creation and recreation are equally easy, as everything occurs by His command alone.\n\nThis meaning is further emphasized in another verse:\n\n\"And it is He who begins creation; then He repeats it, and that is [even] easier for Him. To Him belongs the highest attribute in the heavens and earth. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"\nAr-Rum – no. 30 – verse 27\n\nTherefore, resurrection, judgment, and eternal life in Paradise or Hellfire are not only possible but inevitable. Denying resurrection is a result of forgetting one’s own origin and underestimating the power of the Creator, while Allah’s ability encompasses all things without limit.",

          "question": "How can I be sure 100% that there will be another eternal life after death and eternal paradise and eternal hellfire while I have no clear evidence for this?",
          "answer": "\"And he presents for Us an example and forgets his [own] creation.\nHe says, \"Who will give life to bones while they are\ndisintegrated?\" Say, \"He will give them life who produced them the first time; and He is, of all creation, Knowing.\"\nYaSi n– no. 36 – verse 78 – 79\nNote 1: the most important element in the test Allah put all humans in, is that they should believe in the unseen. That is, you believe in what Allah tell you. However, you do not see it with your own eyes. For, If Allah revealed to humans all the unseen like paradise and hellfire and angels, most humans would believe in Allah in this case, but this belief at this time would be useless because they saw with their own eyes. It is not real belief. And this is exactly what will happen at the day of resurrection; All humans will see everything with their own eyes and they will believe in Allah and in paradise and hellfire, but this belief will not be accepted from them at this time because they did not believe in the unseen Allah had told them about in their life before death.\nNote 2: Allah can easily make all humans believe in Him forcefully. For example, he could deprive all unbelievers from food or water or any vital blessing and grant these to the believers only. In this case, people will look around and will see that food, water and blessings are given only to the believers. So, all people will believe in Allah.\nBut this is not what Allah want. Allah want you to believe in him voluntarily without obligation. He want you to believe in the unseen because if you see it with your eyes, it is not belief at this time. It is something you see with your eyes. Allah do not want a belief which you may be forced to because you need food and water. No, He provide in this life for both believers and unbelievers. So that no one is forced to believe. Allah also want you to believe in the unseen voluntarily and undergo some adversaries and calamities in this life. And if you do this successfully and be patient, you will deserve His biggest reward in the day of resurrection \"eternal paradise\". This is, simply, the logic, of your creator if you can understand.\nNote 3: if you do not believe in Allah, but at the same time you have a lot of blessings like money, good job, good health, children and a good wife, do not be misled by this as Allah provide for both believers and unbelievers in this short life but in the last eternal day paradise is only for the believers. Even more, the unbelievers may have fortunes and blessings in this life far better than the believers. And this proves that this life is nothing for Allah.\n\"And it is Allah who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land and give life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Thus is the resurrection.\"\nFatir– no. 35 – verse 9\n\"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah. Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them\"\nAl Baqarah– no.2 – verse 2 – 3\n\"If you could but see when the criminals are hanging their heads before their Lord, [saying], \"Our Lord, we have seen and heard, so return us [to the world]; we will work righteousness. Indeed, we are [now] certain.\"And if we had willed, we could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me will come into effect [that] \"I will surely fill Hell with jinn and people all together.\nAs Sajdah-no.32 – verse 12,13\nSection B – Questions about religions: Islam, Christianity, Judaism, other religions, Prophet Muhammad and other prophets",

          "question": "So, if prophet Muhammad- as you say -was sent to all mankind without distinction, why should he be from the Arabs specifically and why should the revelation be in Arabic? Why not from any other continent like Europe, America or Africa? Why not in any other language like English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Mandarin, Indian ……. etc.?",
          "answer": "Note: 1 – If Allah chose any language other than Arabic and any nation other than the Arabs for his last revelation, the same questions would be posed by other nations and speakers of different languages: Why this nation? And why this language specifically? But Allah must have His wisdom and knowledge which\nmay not be clear for us in selecting such a nation and such a language for his last revelation.\nNote2: If you refer to history and see how Islam started and spread and how were the Arabs at this time compared to other civilizations around them, you may understand some of Allah's wisdom in this choice. For example, the Arabs were tribal and primitive people whose instinct was still pure. They were more prepared to accept Allah's revelation and to transfer it to other nations. On the other hand, The Roman and the Persian empires around them were civilized empires with all the corruption and wickedness of large empires. So, they were less ready to accept the revelation of Allah.\nNote 3: Compared to other nations and empires at this time, the Arabs were almost the only people who lived without a country, an organized army, an emperor, a king or any organized government. They were primitive tribes with the pure ethics and the strong zeal and prejudice of tribal people.\nAll the previous circumstances may explain some of Allah's wisdom for this choice. You will never understand Allah's wisdom in everything. However, you may discern some of His wisdom if you learn and think neutrally.\n\"And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the language of his people to state clearly for them, and Allah sends astray [thereby] whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"\nIbrahim – no. 14 – verse 4\n\"And when a sign comes to them, they say, \"Never will we believe until we are given like that which was given to the messengers of Allah.\" Allah is most knowing of where He places His message.

They ruled a great part of the world and had strong belief. They did everything possible to spread Islam, the word of Allah, they sacrificed their time, their lives, their fortunes, their children and sacrificed everything dear to them to spread Islam. but later century after century the later generations abandoned their religion’s regulations bit by bit and adopted other ideologies and consequently became weaker and less effective. Other powerful nations controlled most of them by time.\nBut remember that the Arab nation has the potential to be the most powerful and influential nation in the world only if they adopted their religion strongly again.",

          "question": "How can I make sure that this Qur'an was revealed from Allah, the creator and not from any sophisticated liars or professional crooks?",
          "answer": "Note1: Prophet Muhammad was illiterate. That is, he couldn't read or write, and so were most of the people living around him. Literacy was very rare in the Arab tribes at this time. You can refer to history to make sure about this fact. Allah intended that his messenger be illiterate so that the revelation can be a miracle and a sign for the prophet's truthfulness and honesty.\nAllah make this fact clear in the following verses:\nAnd you did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one with your right hand. Otherwise, the falsifiers would have had [cause for] doubt.\"\nAl 'Ankabut– no. 29 – verse 48\nAllah, also, knew that some people would say maybe Muhammad brought this Qur'an from other people or from wizards or from people of scriptures before Islam. Those who knew the bible and the Torah, but Qur'an replied to them with this verse:\n\"And We certainly know that they say, \"It is only a human being who teaches the Prophet.\" The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign, and this Qur'an is [in] a clear Arabic language.\"\nAn Nahl– no. 16 – verse 103\nIf you are still doubtful, Allah challenge all humanity in this verse:\n\"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful. But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.\"\nAl Baqarah– No.2 – verse 23 – 24\nYou may tell me that this challenge doesn't apply to me because my mother language is not Arabic. My answer is: I ask you to try to listen to some Quranic verses. I know you will not understand a single word because you do not understand Arabic, but I am sure you will feel that this is not human language even if you do not understand the meanings because Qur'an is a miraculous revelation.\n\"And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them, \"This is obvious magic.\" Or do they say, \"He has invented it?\" Say, \"If I have invented it, you will not possess for me [the power of protection] from Allah at all. He is most knowing of that in which you are involved. Sufficient is He as Witness between me and you, and He is the Forgiving the Merciful.\"\nAl Ahqaf– no. 46 – verse 7- 8",

          "answer": "Actually, the religion is one because God is one. It is logical. It is a very common mistake to say that there are many religions. Allah told us clearly in His last revelation to humanity that the religion of all prophets was Islam. And it is the only religion that is accepted by\nAllah. People have created many religions and many names for Gods along history, but it is all falsification and illusion. Islam is the only true religion from Allah the one and only creator.\nThe following verses depict this fact clearly:\n\"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah, then indeed, Allah is swift in [taking] account. So if they argue with you, say, \"I have submitted myself to Allah [in Islam], and [so have] those who follow me.\" And say to those who were given the Scripture and [to] the unlearned, \"Have you submitted yourselves?\" And if they submit [in Islam], they are rightly guided; but if they turn away - then upon you is only the [duty of] notification. And Allah is Seeing of [His] servants.\"\nAl 'Imran- no.3 – verse 19 – 20",

          "question": "So, what about other religions like Christianity and Judaism? Aren't these religions sent from Allah either?",
          "answer": "Allah sent all his prophets: Noah, Saleh, Ibrahim, Jacob, Ismael, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad with only one religion and one message. The message all prophets came with was briefly:\n\"Believe in Allah, the one and only God who created you and believe in all his messengers, Books, angels, the Last Day, Paradise and Hellfire\". Believe in Allah and obey His messengers.\nJudaism, Christianity, Islam and all the other books and papers sent to messengers had only one message as explained previously. So, what is the difference?\nThe difference is only in religious legislation\" . That is, the way people should pray or fast or pay money to the poor or how people should deal with each other. This religious legislation was different from one messenger to another to suit the time, the age and the kind of people, but the belief was always the same.\n\"Believe in Allah, your creator and believe in all his messengers, Books, angels, the Last Day, Paradise and Hellfire\". Believe and obey.”\nSo, the question is: Are all these religions or names accepted by Allah now? The answer is definitely “No\".\nAllah accept only Islam as a religion. But, why? The answer, simply, is that the books sent to Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus were relevant to those prophets’ ages only. Every prophet of them was sent to his people at his time, but Prophet Muhammad was sent to all humanity until the last day of this world. Definitely and logically, Allah stipulated that Muslims should believe in Allah's messengers who came before Muhammad, but they should only follow the legislation of Islam because this is the legislation Allah wanted for our time.\nThe following verses explain these points:\n\"Say, \"We have believed in Allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants, and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [submitting] to Him. \"And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\nAl 'Imran– no.3 – verse 84 – 85",

          "question": "But the adherents of each religion or sect call the others unbelievers. And they sometimes kill each other. Every sect assumes that it is the only one on the right track. How do you explain this?",
          "answer": "This has been the habit throughout history and will always be the habit. People disagreed about their prophets and invented strange sects out of the true religion. This happened almost with all the messengers we know from Moses to Muhammad.\nThis fact is illustrated clearly in the following Hadeeth and verses:\nIt was narrated from ‘Awf bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said:\n“The Jews split into seventy-one sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy in Hell. The Christians split into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which will be in Hell and one in Paradise. I swear by the One Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, my nation will split into seventy-three sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy- two in Hell.” It was said: “O Messenger of Allah, who are they?” He said: “They are the Muslims who follow what I and my companions do.”\nSunan Ibn Majah 3992 - Book 36, Hadith 67\n\"And We gave Jesus, the Son of Mary, clear proofs, and We supported him with the Pure Spirit. If Allah had willed, those [generations] succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them. But they differed, and some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other, but Allah does what He intends.\"\nAl Baqarah– no. 2 – verse 253\n\"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam.

          "question": "Christians have beliefs like the Trinity, Jesus is God, God is Jesus, or Jesus is the son of God. How does Islam see these beliefs?",
          "answer": "Islam categorically rejects all beliefs that attribute divinity, sonship, or partnership to anyone besides Allah. According to Islam, Allah is absolutely One, unique, and incomparable. Nothing resembles Him in any way. He was not born from a woman, nor does He beget children. Allah does not need a wife, a companion, or a son. These human attributes imply weakness, need, and limitation, all of which are impossible for the Creator of everything.\n\nHow can Allah, the Creator of everything small and great, be compared to human beings with their inherent weaknesses, ignorance, and dependency? Attributing a child or partners to Allah is a grave falsehood and an immense injustice against His absolute perfection.\n\nThis fundamental truth is clearly and concisely stated in the Qur'an:\n\n\"Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One. Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent.'\"\nAl-Ikhlas – no. 112 – verses 1–4\n\nThese verses define the Islamic concept of God with complete clarity, negating all forms of sonship, incarnation, or resemblance to creation.\n\nThe Qur'an further describes how severe and intolerable the claim of attributing a son to Allah is, to the extent that even the heavens and the earth almost collapse from its gravity:\n\n\"And they say, 'The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son.' You have done an atrocious thing. The heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation. That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son. And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son. There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant. He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting. And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone.\"\nMaryam – no. 19 – verses 88–95\n\nRegarding the doctrine of the Trinity, Allah gives a clear and severe warning:\n\n\"They have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the third of three.' And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.\"\nAl-Ma'idah – no. 5 – verse 73\n\nAllah also explains that the claim of divine sonship is not new, but rather a repetition of false beliefs made by previous nations:\n\n\"The Jews say, 'Ezra is the son of Allah'; and the Christians say, 'The Messiah is the son of Allah.' That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?\"\nAt-Tawbah – no. 9 – verse 30\n\nFinally, the Qur'an describes a decisive scene from the Day of Judgment, when Jesus himself will be questioned about these false claims:\n\n\"And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, 'O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?' He will say, 'Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen. I said not to them except what You commanded me – to worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness.'\"\nAl-Ma'idah – no. 5 – verses 116–117\n\nThus, Islam honors Jesus as a noble prophet and messenger of Allah, but firmly rejects all claims of divinity, sonship, or partnership with Allah. Pure monotheism (Tawhid) is the core of Islamic belief, and any deviation from it is considered a serious misguidance.",

          "answer": "It is you who should give me evidence that he is God or the son of God. Jesus himself never claimed this. He was a messenger like all the messengers. He was a human who ate food, drank water and lived like a human. He had the body of a human. But Allah granted him some supernatural abilities and miracles to support his message. And Jesus was not the first prophet to be granted these miracles.\nOther prophets before him were granted different miracles like\nSaleh and Moses. Allah granted Jesus many supernatural abilities to support his message and to test his people.\nThis fact is clear in Qur'an:\n( 110 ) [The Day] when Allah will say, \"O Jesus, Son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Pure Spirit and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and [remember] when I taught you writing and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you designed from clay [what was] like the form of a bird with My permission, then you breathed into it, and it became a bird with My permission; and you healed the blind and the leper with My permission; and when you brought forth the dead with My permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from [killing] you when you came to them with clear proofs and those who disbelieved among them said, \"This is not but obvious magic.\"\nAl Ma\"idah – No. 5 – Verse 110\nSome people believed that Jesus may be the son of God because he was born without a father which was a great miracle. But Adam the father of all humanity was created without a father or a mother which is a more surprising miracle. So, why didn't they say about Adam that he is God or the son of God?\nThis fact is being told in Qur’an:\n\"Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him, \"Be,\" and he was.\nThe truth is from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters. Then whoever argues with you about it after [this] knowledge has come to you - say, \"Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our\nwomen and your women, ourselves and yourselves, then supplicate\nearnestly [together] and invoke the curse of Allah upon the liars [among us].\"\nAl 'Imran– no. 3 – verse 59 – 61\nAllah give strong warnings to the Christians in the following verses:\n\"O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a messenger of Allah and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul [created at a command] from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, \"Three\"; desist - it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.\nAn Nisa– no. 4 – verse 171\n\"Never would the Messiah disdain to be a servant of Allah, nor would the angels near [to Him].

          "question": "Christians believe that their religion is a universal one. And Jesus Christ was sent to all mankind. Do you have evidence against this in Islam?",
          "answer": "Yes, I give you evidence against this from sound human logic, from Qur'an and from the Gospel respectively.\n-\tEvidence from Human Logic\n-\t\tHow can a religion be universal to all mankind, if it has no detailed legislation for all the details in the human life?\nActually, Christianity is only pieces of spiritual advice. What should we do with someone who killed another one intentionally? What should we do with a thief? How should we punish a thug who takes people's property by force? How should people behave when they borrow or lend money?\nWhat should be done with the fortune of someone when he passes away? How much should everyone in his family take from this fortune? These and many other basic questions have no answers in Christianity. In fact, Christians all over the world follow the human legislations of their own countries in all their\nlife details. These legislations are man-made of course. And they differ considerably from one country to another. And Christians, in some Arab countries, even, depend on the Islamic legislation concerning “inheritance\". On the other hand, if you study Islam, you will find surprising detailed legislation for every minor detail in the life of a Muslim and a Muslim society.\nChristianity- in fact – is not a complete religion. Jesus was sent to the Jews to guide and correct their deviation and uncontrolled love of material life. He did not come with legislation for everything in humans' life to be qualified as a religion for humanity. Jesus himself repeated many times \"I did not come to change Moses' legislation.\" He also said; \"I was sent to these Jews, sons of Jacob.\"\nEvidence from Qur'an\n-\tIn Qur'an Allah say about Jesus\n-\t\"And [mention] when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, \"O children of Israel, indeed I am the messenger of Allah to you confirming what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad.\" But when he came to them with clear evidences, they said, \"This is obvious magic.\"\n-\tAs Saff – no. 61 – verse 6\nHowever, Qur'an says about Muhammad\n\"And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. But most of the people do not know.\"\nSaba\" – no. 34 – verse 28\nWhereas the first verse states that Jesus was only sent to the Israeli people and at the same time giving tidings of another prophet\nfollowing him, the second verse declares that Muhammad was sent to all mankind comprehensively.\nEvidence from the Gospel:\nduring his earthly ministry, Jesus explicitly declared his mission to be focused only on Israel (Matt 15:24).\nHe claimed that his mission was only to the “lost sheep of the house of Israel” (Matt 15:24),\nOther statements reinforce Jewish priority during the ministry of Jesus, including his decision to choose twelve disciples (corresponding, most likely, to the twelve tribes of Israel)\n(Matt 15:31).",

          "question": "Jews also believe that they are the only beloved and preferred nation by Allah from all nations. And they are the children of God? How does Islam see this concept?",
          "answer": "Evidence from Human Logic:\nHow can the great creator be biased with his creatures? How can He prefer a specific nation or people without fair justification? All humans are created by one God. So, it is logical and fair to deal with them equally. Even, humans disgust any unfair practices from other humans. So, how can we attribute the great creator with such unfair practices among His servants?\nJews have never asked people throughout history to follow their religion. They consider it a religion only for themselves or for the elite. And they consider themselves the unique people in this world. Also, they have strange racist beliefs that always claim that they are the chosen nation by Allah and they are the only nation whom Allah love and they are the only nation that will be saved from the Fire.\nThis is one big proof Judaism is a biased and incomplete religion. Allah discuss and answer their biased allegations logically in Qur’an.\nEvidence from Qur'an:\n( 18 ) But the Jews and the Christians say, \"We are the children of Allah and His beloved.\" Say, \"Then why does He punish you for your sins?\" Rather, you are human beings from among those He has created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and to Him is the [final] destination.\nAl Ma\"idah – no.5 – verse 18\nAllah challenge the Jews in the following verses to wish for death if they are the allies of Allah as they claim:\n( 6 ) Say, \"O you who are Jews, if you claim that you are allies of Allah, excluding the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.\"\n( 7 ) But they will not wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers.\n( 8 ) Say, \"Indeed, the death from which you flee - indeed, it will meet you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you about what you used to do.\"\nAl Jumu'ah – no. 62 – verse 6 – 8\nAgain, Allah discuss their false allegations logically in these verses:\n( 80 ) And they say, \"Never will the Fire touch us, except for a few days.\" Say, \"Have you taken a covenant with Allah? For Allah will never break His covenant. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know?\"\nAl Baqarah – no.2 – verse 80\nExplanation:\nIn the previous verses, Allah refute their false allegations that they are the chosen nation or that they are the only paradise dwellers and challenge them to prove their truthfulness by wishing death which they will never do.",

          "question": "I think every prophet had his own religion. Judaism was the religion of Moses. Christianity was the religion of Jesus and Islam was the religion of Muhammad? Am I right?",
          "answer": "No, I told you before that there aren't different religions. Allah revealed only one religion to all his messengers, but this religion had different legislations to suit different ages and circumstances. So, it is right to say that Moses was given a legislation to his nation. But Jesus was not given new legislation. He was following the legislation of Moses. Jesus was given spiritual teachings to control and curb the excessive materialism of the Jews. Muhammad was given a legislation for the people from his time to the end of time. But Prophets Abraham, Isaac, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad had one religion. Only one religion but with different legislations to suit the different ages.\nThis is obvious in the following verses:\n\"And who would be averse to the religion of Abraham except one who makes a fool of himself. And We had chosen him in this world, and indeed he, in the Hereafter, will be among the righteous. When his Lord said to him, \"Submit\", he said \"I have submitted [in Islam] to the Lord of the worlds.\" And Abraham instructed his sons [to do the same] and [so did] Jacob, [saying], \"O my sons, indeed Allah has chosen for you this religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims.\" Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, when he said to his sons, \"What will you worship after me?\" They said, \"We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac - one God. And we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.\"\nAl Baqarah- No. 2 – verse 130 – 133",

And never associate anyone or anything to Allah. Allah is incomparable. Worship and obey only Him. And there is another eternal life after death where good doers will be granted paradise forever and wrong doers will be afflicted by hellfire forever\"\nThis was the message of all prophets to all humans throughout the different ages of human history.\nThis message is clear enough in the following verses:\n\"O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous -[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you.

That is, the way people should live, pray, fast, pay money to the poor and deal with each other…etc.? The legislation was slightly different according to every age and its requirements and according to the evils that were widespread among a specific nation.\nHowever, some legislations were the same with different prophets. For example, all the prophets prohibited all kinds of wines and pork. Killing without reason, thuggery and theft were forbidden and disdained by all prophets. …. etc. Differences were slight not major.\nGenerally speaking, all prophets were instructed to forbid the evil practices and to permit the good, fair and useful deeds.",

And Allah must have ordered them to follow and obey Muhammad when his time comes. But I did not hear anything about Muhammad in the Torah or the Bible. How do you explain this?",
          "answer": "Of course, he was mentioned in all these books. But everything was deleted and changed intentionally throughout the ages.\nThis fact is explicit in Qur'an:\n\"Those to whom We have given the Scripture recognize Muhammad as they recognize their [own] sons. Those who will lose themselves [in the Hereafter] do not believe.\"\nAl An'am– no. 6 – verse 20\n\"And when a messenger from Allah came to them confirming that which was with them, a party of those who had been given the Scripture threw the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know [what it contained].\nAl Baqarah-no.2 – verse 101\nHere Allah state that the Jews know the attributes of prophet Muhammad more than they know their own children, but they concealed the truth intentionally:\n\"Those to whom We gave the Scripture know him as they know their own sons. But indeed, a party of them conceal the truth while they know [it].\"\nAl Baqarah-no.2 – verse 146\nNote1: The Jews in Medina at the time of prophet Muhammad knew from their books that a messenger will be sent in this time and in this place and they knew his characteristics very precisely from their Torah. And they were the people who spread this news among the tribes of Madinah. But they thought that this prophet would be from the Jews not from the Arabs. When the prophet came to be from the Arabs, they disbelieved in him only out of jealousy and arrogance. Refer to history to make sure of this incident.\nThese verses brief the story:\n\"And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so, the curse of Allah will be upon the disbelievers.\"\nAl Baqarah-no.2 – verse 89",

So, Allah allowed people to do sinful acts in this life Although Allah do not like these acts. But he gave them the chance, the time and the will because it is only a test. For example, people kill, steal, rob, lie and commit adultery. It is the same idea as distorting or changing the revelation. All of these are atrocious human sinful acts that people commit.\nDo Allah like killing, stealing, robbing or committing adultery? Definitely no. but he allowed people to do these acts to test them. Similarly, he let these people to distort and change His revelation to prove to them their wicked and malignant nature and to test other people at the same time. Who is going to follow the distorted revelation? And Who is going to search for the righteous truth?\nAnyway, it is Allah’s wisdom and destiny. We have no choice.\nAllah threaten those who changed His revelation in return for some world benefits in these verses:\n( 79 ) So woe to those who write the \"scripture\" with their own hands, then say, \"This is from Allah,\" in order to exchange it for a small price.

          "answer": "Well, I am not an expert in comparative religions. I am a normal Muslim as I told you. But you can test the validity and credibility of any of these religions in a simple way. Try to find answers- in these religions- to some of the basic questions I have answered you from an Islamic perspective. You can do this easily online and see how valid and credible are these beliefs. The basic questions in part one could be a preliminary criterion or a touchstone to test the validity and the credibility of these religions. Basic questions about God, His qualities, why He created us, how should we lead a good life, what awaits us after death and other basic questions can show the authenticity and the logic of any religion. Don’t be misguided by\nthe number of people who embrace one religion or another. The number of followers can never be a biased criterion because many people along the history of humanity are mindless and fanatic. They follow a specific group or belief blindly not logically. Can any religion on Earth give you logical, reasonable and comprehensive answers to some of the basic questions you are asking about now? Search on your own. I tried to give you the answers from Islam. You can compare and decide for yourself.",

          "answer": "Those \"Mazahib\" or different Jurisprudences you are talking about are not a disadvantage of Islam. On the contrary, they are an advantage because they made Islam a very flexible religion. They never disagreed about the basics of Islam like the main faith and the pillars of Islam. They only disagreed in marginal things like the way you raise your hand during praying or the way you do a specific thing. These minor disagreements are a result of different reasons. But in the end, they make Islam a very flexible jurisprudence which is viable to be applied everywhere and at any time provided that you do not change the basics which are the main faith and the pillars of Islam.",

          "question": "You frequently include in your answers some hadeeths from Prophet Muhammad. Are his hadeeths very important in Islam? Do Muslims have to obey the prophet in everything he says in his hadeeths? Is there evidence in Quran about this?",
          "answer": "Prophet Muhammad's “hadeeths” or sayings are an integral part of Islam. You cannot understand many verses of Qur’an unless you read Prophet Muhammad’s “Hadeeths or sayings.\n\"Certainly, did Allah confer [great] favor upon the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom, although they had been before in manifest error.\nAl 'Imran– no.3 – verse 164\n\"Just as We have sent among you a messenger from yourselves reciting to you Our verses and purifying you and teaching you the Book and wisdom and teaching you that which you did not know.\"\nAl Baqarah- no.2 – verse 151\nNote the 2 underlined words in both verses: the book and wisdom\nMost of Islamic scholars in Tafseer agreed that the words: the book and wisdom in these verses refer to Qura'n and Sunnah. Also , Islamic scholars agreed that sunnah should be followed as it is the second source of Islamic legislation after Qura'n. In fact, Sunnah is an explanation and clarification to many of the Qura'n verses. You can never apply details of prayers, fasting and all pillars of Islam unless you study Sunnah in detail. The prophet, even, warned us from some people in our age who are alleging that they will abide only by Qur'an and abandon Sunnah. In fact, these people are very wicked and cunning. They want neither Qur'an nor Sunnah. And they know very well that you will never be able to abide by Qur'an if you neglect Sunnah. Actually, Qur'an and Sunnah are twins. You have to study both side by side to understand Islam. It could be said that Sunnah is always a practical application of Islam and sometimes an explanation of Quranic verses.\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said: Beware! I have been given the Qur'an and something like it, yet the time is coming when a man replete on his couch will say: Keep to the Qur'an; what you find in it to be permissible treat as permissible, and what you find in it to be prohibited treat as prohibited. Beware! …….\"\nSunan Abi Dawud 4604\nEnglish translation: Book 41, Hadith 4587\nAllah confirm the necessity of obeying and respecting His messenger in many verses:\n\"But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.\"\nAn Nisa – no. 4 – verse 65\n\"O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best [way] and best in result.\"\nAn Nisa – no. 4 – verse 59\n\"Say, [O Muhammad], \"If you should love Allah, then follow me, [so] Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\"\nAl 'Imran– no. 3 – verse 31\n\"And obey Allah and obey the Messenger; but if you turn away - then upon Our Messenger is only [the duty of] clear notification.\nAt Taghabun– no. 64 – verse 12",

          "answer": "Generally speaking, disagreements always happen among humans. Disagreements among the companions happened not only after prophet Muhammad, but they also happened during his life – again- these disagreements were not on the basics or the pillars of Islam. They were on the marginal things. Moreover, they were not disagreements on the basic belief. Rather, they were political disagreements. Islam is not rigid. It is a flexible religion. In other words, it can accommodate different opinions and styles of living provided that you do not change the basics of the belief.\nYes, some of the companions of the Prophet disagreed and even had battles but every part thought they were on the right side.\nEvery party had their own understanding. And these disagreements were few. And some hypocrites ignited these battles. Companions of the prophet were very pious, honest and dedicated. Allah commended them in Qur’an and the prophet did in his Hadeeths. Anyway, it was part of the long test destined by Allah.\nSection C – Questions about widespread accusations against Islam and misconceptions about Allah's laws in this life.",

          "question": "I heard that the first Muslims were very powerful, very good- mannered and very advanced during, approximately, the first three centuries of Islam, but it is very different now. So, if Islam was the right religion for all humanity, as you say, then why are many Muslim countries and Muslim individuals nowadays weak, underdeveloped and uncivilized? And there are a lot of conflicts and strives among them?",
          "answer": "Note1: Muslims became the main power in the world after about 50 years from the outset of Islam because they adhered to Qur'an and Prophet Muhammad's teachings. When they started to abandon Islam teachings and ignore Qur'an and Sunna's regulations, they became weaker and more corrupt bit by bit until the present day.\nActually, Muslims’ lack of civilization and backwardness in spite of having the true religion from Allah is great evidence that Allah do not favor any nation or He has no bias for a specific nation. In other words, if any nation from the unbelievers worked hard in life and learnt and followed the reasons of power and wealth, Allah would give them power and livelihood as long as they work hard and honestly. On the contrary, if a nation of believers does not follow the reasons of power and wealth, they will be backward and uncivilized even if they have the true religion of Allah. Definitely, Allah is fair. He is unbiased even with unbelievers.\nMuslim countries will never retain the powerful and prestigious status of their ancestors until they abide by the regulations of Islam very strongly, work hard in life and follow the reasons of power and wealth. This is one of Allah's laws in this life as it is explained in the following verses:\n\"And how many a city was insolent toward the command of its Lord and His messengers, so We took it to severe account and punished it with a terrible punishment.\"\nAt Talaq-no.65 – verse – 8\n\"Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned so He may let them taste part of [the consequence of] what they have done that perhaps they will return [to righteousness].\"\nAr Rum– no. 30 – verse 41\n( 96 ) And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah, We would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth; but they denied [the messengers], so We seized them for what they were earning.\"\nAl A'raf – No. 7 – verse 96\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said: The people will soon summon one another to attack you as people when eating invite others to share their dish. Someone asked: Will that be because of our small numbers at that time? He replied: No, you will be numerous at that time: but you will be scum and rubbish like that carried down by a torrent, and Allah will take fear of you from the breasts of your enemy and last “Wahan” enervation into your hearts. Someone asked: What is “wahan” (enervation). Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): He replied: Love of the world and dislike of death.\nGrade:\tSahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 4297:\nIn-book reference: Book 39, Hadith 7\nEnglish translation: 38 , Hadith: 4284",

          "question": "But I heard that this religion spread by wars and violence. And that Muslims invaded many countries where they spread their religion by force.",
          "answer": "All Muslims' wars aimed at 3 targets:\n1.\tIntimidating some neighbor countries who were threatening Muslims and showing aggressive behavior.\n2.\tSpreading Islam among those who wanted it willingly but were unable to embrace it because of the unfair power of their emperors or kings. So, Muslims never forced anyone to accept Islam. Rather, they wanted to give everyone in this world the free will to choose for himself what he likes away from any unfair power exercised on him.\nSo, no forcing or compulsory practices were exercised to accept Islam. Conversely, they were donating everyone the free will to choose his religion.\nIn all Muslim wars, prophet Muhammad was instructing them to offer 3 choices to their opponents: to accept Islam, or to pay tribute \"jizya” or to have war with them.\nBut why must they pay tribute if they will not accept Islam? Is this an indirect way to force them to accept Islam? Of course, not for two reasons:\n1.\tEven if they accept Islam, they will pay \"zakat\" for poor people. \"the 3rd pillar of Islam\" that rich people should pay a small amount of their money to the poor. So, in both cases, they will pay.\n2.\t\"jizia\" is being paid for the purpose of defending this country. Or that Muslims wanted to make sure by this Jizya that this country will be allegiant to the Muslims in the future and they will not start a war against them. In the meantime, Muslims will use this money to defend this nation against any enemies. And any way, it was the verdict of Allah who know what is best for his servants.\nAnswer from Qur’an\n\"And what is [the matter] with you that you fight not in the cause of Allah and [for] the oppressed among men, women, and children who say, \"Our Lord, take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from Yourself a protector and appoint for us from Yourself a helper?\"\nAn Nisa – no. 4 – verse 75\nIn the previous verse Allah explain for us that fighting against the unbeliever oppressor emperors and kings is very important because it is the only way helpless and weak people can get rid of these oppressors and have the freedom to worship Allah\n\"They ask you about the sacred month - about fighting therein. Say, \"Fighting therein is great [sin], but averting [people] from the way of Allah and disbelief in Him and [preventing access to] al-Masjid al-Haram and the expulsion of its people therefrom are greater [evil] in the sight of Allah. And fitnah is greater than killing.\" And they will continue to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able…..\"\nAl Baqarah– no. 2 – verse 217\n\"Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not.\"\nAl Baqarah– no. 2 – verse 216 Answer from “Sunnah”\nSulaiman bin Buraidah reported on the authority of his father. When the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) appointed a Commander over an Army or a detachment, he instructed him to fear Allah himself and consider the welfare of the Muslims who were with him. He then said “When you meet the polytheists who are your enemy, summon them one of three things and accept whichever of them they are willing to agree to, and refrain from them. Summon them to Islam and if they agree, accept it from them and refrain from them. Then summon them to\nleave their territory and transfer to the abode of the Emigrants and tell them that if they do so, they will have the same rights and responsibilities as the Emigrants, but if they refuse and choose their own abode, tell them that they will be like the desert Arabs who are Muslims subject to Allah’s jurisdiction which applies to the believers, but will have no spoil or booty unless they strive with the Muslims. If they refuse demand jizyah (poll tax) from them, if they agree accept it from them and refrain from them. But if they refuse, seek Allah’s help and fight with them. When you invade the fortress and they (its people) offer to capitulate and have the matter referred to Allah’s jurisdiction, do not grant this, for you do not know whether or not you will hit on Allah’s jurisdiction regarding them. But let them capitulate and have the matter refereed to your jurisdiction and make a decision about them later on as you wish.\nSahih (Al-Albani)\tSunan Abi Dawud 2612 Book 15, Hadith 136 :\nBook 14, Hadith 2606 :",

          "question": "Was fighting obligatory for Muslims? They didn’t have any other peaceful solutions?",
          "answer": "you will always find that Muslims were not the initial aggressors. Firstly, they were attacked. After that, they went to war to defend themselves.\n(Refer to history to confirm the authenticity of this information)\nIslam started peacefully. There was no fighting at the beginning. Muslims wanted to spread their true religion peacefully among people. They didn't force people to be Muslims. But sovereign nations and empires saw in Islam a big threat to their tyranny and sovereignty over their nations. Islamic fair legislations were generally against the interests of rich, powerful and leading people who were greedy for money and power at the expense of other poor people. So, these sovereign nations started aggression against Islam. When the new religion was in danger, Allah ordered his Muslim servants to defend their religion by fighting in order to give the fair chance to\nall people in all nations to see and understand Islam. And in the end, it is up to their discretion to embrace Islam or not.\nFor example, Al-Harith Ibn Umair Al-Azdy, the messenger of Prophet Muhammad to the Romans, was killed by Shurahbeel ibn ‘Amr Al- Ghassaani, the king of Busraa in Ash-Shaam. The prophet's messenger was sent only to call them to Islam peacefully. But he was killed brutally, contrary to the usual generous and protective behavior towards messengers at that time.\nBefore this incident, relations between the Muslims and the Romans were strained, for the Romans together with their Arab allies used to aggravate and provoke the Muslims by any means. This was particularly apparent in their frequent attempts to attack the Muslim merchandise coming from Ash-Shaam (Greater Syria) and the plundering of the caravans threading their roads, not to speak of the stress and grief that they subjected to every Muslim they could seize.\nConsequently, the Prophet, ( MPBUH ), called the Muslims to go out to fight the Romans so that he would discipline them and put an end to their barbarian conduct. Quickly, three thousand warriors assembled and it was the battle of Mu'tah.\nSo, Muslims were ordered to defend their religion and defend other people's freedom to accept or refuse Islam. Muslims were not fighting for power or money. They were only trying to give other poor people in sovereign nations the freedom to select the religion they wanted.\nThese ideas are explained in the following verses:\n( 256 ) There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.\nAl Baqarah – no.2 – verse 256\n( 39 ) Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory.\n( 40 ) [They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, \"Our Lord is Allah.\" And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might.\nAl Hajj – no. 22 – verse 39 – 40",

          "question": "What about slavery? I heard that Muslims were taking captives in war as slaves. Is this true?",
          "answer": "Yes, slavery did exist in the Muslim world, but understanding Islam’s position on slavery requires historical context and a fair comparison with how slavery existed before and outside Islam.\n\nSlavery was savagely rampant in all nations before the advent of Islam and was widespread among people of all religions. There were many sources of slavery, including warfare, debt (where a debtor who could not repay became a slave), kidnapping, raids, poverty, and need. In short, there were numerous ways to enslave people, while the means of freeing slaves were almost nonexistent.\n\nWhen Islam came, it completely changed this reality. Islam restricted and regulated slavery, blocked most of its sources, and opened many doors for manumission. While slavery had many entry points before Islam, Islam limited it to only one source: enslavement through war, and only in the case of unbelieving prisoners of war, along with their women and children.\n\nAt the same time, Islam introduced numerous ways to free slaves and strongly encouraged manumission as an act of worship and expiation for sins. Thus, Islam was generally against slavery as a system, but dealt with an already existing global institution in a gradual, realistic, and humane way.\n\nIn fact, Muslims were the most merciful among all nations in dealing with war captives. While captives in other civilizations were often killed, tortured, or imprisoned for years under inhumane conditions, Islam commanded that captives be treated with mercy, kindness, and dignity.\n\nYes, Muslims did take unbelieving war captives as slaves by divine legislation. However, they were commanded to treat them with compassion and justice. This close interaction allowed captives to observe Islam directly, often leading them to accept it willingly. At the same time, Islam encouraged their freedom through many means.\n\nThis ruling also carried a divine wisdom and punishment. It is as though Allah was saying: because these people arrogantly refused to submit to their Creator, the Most Merciful, they would experience servitude to other human beings. Allah is All-Knowing and All-Wise in His judgments, and humans can only attempt to understand part of His wisdom.\n\nBelow is a brief summary of some of the Islamic principles governing the treatment of slaves, as mentioned in authentic hadiths:\n\n1. Equality in food and clothing\nThe slaves’ food and clothing should be the same as that of their masters.\n\nIt was narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:\n\"They are your brothers whom Allah has put under your authority. So if Allah has put a person’s brother under his authority, let him feed him from what he eats and clothe him from what he wears. Do not overburden him with work, and if you do overburden him, then help him.\"\nAl-Bukhari (6050)\n\n2. Preserving their dignity\nIslam strictly forbade humiliating or falsely accusing slaves.\n\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:\n\"Whoever accuses his slave of something he did not do will be flogged on the Day of Resurrection unless he is as he said.\"\nAl-Bukhari (6858)\n\nIbn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) freed a slave and said:\n\"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Whoever slaps his slave or beats him, his expiation is to manumit him.\"\nMuslim (1657)\n\n3. Fairness and kindness in treatment\nMany of the companions applied these teachings practically.\n\n‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan once tweaked the ear of a slave and later insisted that the slave retaliate against him, saying he feared punishment on the Day of Resurrection.\n\nWhen ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf walked among his slaves, no one could distinguish him from them, as he dressed and walked just like them.\n\n‘Umar ibn al-Khattab once saw slaves standing while their master ate alone. He rebuked him and ordered the slaves to eat with him.\n\nSalman al-Farisi, while serving as a governor, was seen kneading dough himself. When asked why, he replied that he had sent his servant on an errand and did not want to burden him with two tasks.\n\n4. Slaves may surpass free people in merit\nIslam recognizes merit and competence regardless of social status. A slave may excel over a free person in religious or worldly matters. It is even valid for a slave to lead the prayer. ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) had a slave who used to lead her in prayer. Muslims were commanded to obey leaders even if a slave was appointed over them.\n\n5. The right to buy one’s freedom (Mukaatabah)\nIslam allowed and encouraged slaves to purchase their freedom through a contract with their masters if goodness was found in them.\n\nAllah says in the Qur'an:\n\"And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] from among whom your right hands possess – then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you.\"\nAn-Nur – no. 24 – verse 33\n\nThis is how Islam established justice, mercy, and human dignity in a world where slavery was once brutal and unchecked.\n\nThe French historian Gustave Le Bon said in his book *Hadaarat al-‘Arab (Arab Civilization)*:\n\"What I sincerely believe is that slavery among the Muslims is better than slavery among any other people, and that the situation of slaves in the East is better than that of servants in Europe. Slaves in the East are part of the family. Slaves who wanted to be free could attain freedom by expressing their wish, but despite that, they did not resort to exercising this right.\"",

          "question": "But in our age, everyone can see that terrorism and slaying have become closely related to Islam everywhere, to the extent that many nations have come to associate Islam with terrorism. How does Islam respond to this accusation?",
          "answer": "Islam categorically rejects terrorism, murder, and unlawful killing in all its forms. Killing is one of the most forbidden and gravely sinful acts in Islam, whether the victim is a Muslim or a non-Muslim. The sanctity of human life is a fundamental principle in Islamic law.\n\nEven during times of war, Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) laid down strict moral rules that prohibited the killing of non-combatants. He commanded his companions not to kill old people, children, babies, or women. Islamic mercy extended even to animals and insects.\n\nThe first Muslim caliph, Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), advised the army commander Abu ‘Ubaydah when sending him to war, saying: \"Do not kill women, children, or the elderly. Do not slaughter a camel or a cow except for food. Do not burn palm trees or drown bees.\" These instructions were given in wartime. If this was Islamic conduct during war, then mercy and justice in times of peace are even more emphasized.\n\nAll acts of killing, terrorism, and bloodshed are completely alien to Islam. Those who commit such crimes while claiming to be Muslims are either ignorant of Islam, deliberately distorting it, or acting as mercenaries serving political and financial agendas. Some perpetrators may be Muslims, but they grossly misunderstand Islamic teachings. Others are paid agents whose goal is to tarnish the image of Islam and divert people from believing in Allah and embracing the true religion.\n\nIt is no secret that many individuals, organizations, and media institutions actively work to slander Islam for reasons related to power, control, political influence, economic interests, or blind bias toward other beliefs. The spread of Islam as a complete way of life conflicts with the interests of many global systems and industries.\n\nAllah says in the Qur'an:\n\n\"And never will the Jews or the Christians approve of you until you follow their religion. Say, 'Indeed, the guidance of Allah is the only guidance.' If you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would have against Allah no protector or helper.\"\nAl-Baqarah – no. 2 – verse 120\n\nTherefore, anyone who truly seeks to understand Islam must avoid judging it through media propaganda, sensational news, or the actions of criminals. Islam should be understood through its primary sources: the Qur'an with its sound explanation by Sunni scholars, and the authentic Sunnah with its correct interpretation. Islam must not be judged by mercenaries, blood traffickers, or ignorant and hypocritical Muslims who prioritize personal interests over their religion.\n\nThe Qur'an and the Sunnah repeatedly describe unlawful killing as a major and destructive sin.\n\nAllah says:\n\n\"Say, 'Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you: that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them. And do not approach immoralities – what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right.'\"\nAl-An‘am – no. 6 – verse 151\n\nAllah also says:\n\n\"Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption done in the land – it is as if he had slain all mankind. And whoever saves one – it is as if he had saved all mankind.\"\nAl-Ma'idah – no. 5 – verse 32\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said:\n\n\"Whoever kills a Mu‘ahid (a non-Muslim under Muslim protection) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise, though its fragrance can be smelled from a distance of forty years.\"\nSahih al-Bukhari – Book 87, Hadith 52\n\nHe (ﷺ) also said:\n\n\"The first matter concerning which people will be judged on the Day of Resurrection will be the matter of blood.\"\nAl-Bukhari and Muslim\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) further warned:\n\n\"Avoid the seven destructive sins.\" He mentioned among them: \"killing a soul which Allah has forbidden except by right.\"\nAl-Bukhari and Muslim\n\nIn a powerful narration, Ibn ‘Abbas reported that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:\n\n\"The slain person will bring his killer on the Day of Resurrection, holding his forelock and head, with blood flowing from his veins, saying: 'O Lord, he killed me,' until they reach the Throne.\"\n\nIbn ‘Abbas then recited Allah’s saying:\n\n\"And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell.\"\n\nThis verse, he said, was never abrogated and carries a severe and lasting warning.\n\nThus, Islam stands firmly against terrorism, murder, and bloodshed. Any attempt to associate Islam with terrorism is either based on ignorance or deliberate distortion. Islam is a religion of justice, mercy, and the sanctity of human life.",

And some of them were true believers but they were misguided to believe that killing innocent people was a kind of “Jihad”.\nOf course, it is impossible to say who were “paid mercenaries” and who were “true Muslims but misguided”? because such information is usually unavailable to ordinary people. Moreover, most Islamic groups that took to fighting and killing innocents were a combination of both the mercenaries and the misguided Muslims.\nAllah know all the hidden secrets. And He will reveal to us everything on the Day of Judgment. And everyone will be evaluated fairly.",

          "question": "I heard that religious verdicts in Islam are severe. For example, a thief’s hand should be cut off. A killer must be killed. A thug must be punished by cutting off one hand and one leg from the opposite side. Aren’t these Islamic verdicts severe and against human rights in our modern world?",
          "answer": "Human rights are a great and noble issue, but they should be given to innocent and normal people who deserve them, not to thieves and criminals. If human rights are given blindly to thieves and criminals, crimes will increase uncontrollably which is happening nowadays in many countries.\nOn the contrary, these verdicts are compatible with human rights in our age because when people recognize that the punishment will be very severe. They will think a lot before committing any crime. Ultimately, this will save innocent people from crimes and will save people with criminal inclinations from being criminals or from losing parts of their bodies.\nThis is human nature; people with criminal inclinations tend to commit crimes when they feel that they may get away unpunished or that the punishment may be light.\nHow do modern countries treat thieves and criminals? They are imprisoned for different periods according to each country's laws. What happens is that many prisoners become more cruel and professional criminals after they finish their sentences. In addition, they cost the country a lot of money for accommodation, food, medical care, guarding…. etc.\nIslam's verdicts are practical, realistic and decisive. They eradicate the crimes before they start because people feel too much scared from committing a crime because of the severe punishment. As a result, the percentage of crimes decline dramatically. And the society becomes a safe place. Secondly, these verdicts cost the country much less than imprisoning people.\nStudy what happens in the world and you will find that countries which equip their prisons with means of entertainment and all life requirements are the same countries that have a high percentage\nof crimes. Why should prisoners abandon their crimes when the punishment is so light and the prison is comfortable? Again, it is human nature.\nThese verdicts were preordained by Allah, the all-knowing and the most merciful. He is the creator of people. And He is the one who know what is good for them.\nFinally, in some crimes it is very hard to prove the crime on the perpetrator and carry out the verdict because Allah stipulate harsh conditions for proving the crime. So, it is not cruel or very harsh as you think.",

Actually, this is a sign that Prophet Muhammad had told us it would happen near the end of time.\nRead the following Hadeeths:\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:\nIslam initiated as something strange, and it would revert to its (old position) of being strange. so good tidings for the stranger.\nSahih Muslim 145 - Book 1, Hadith 279\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Islam began as something strange and will go back to being strange, so glad tidings to the strangers.” It was said: “Who are the strangers?’ He said: “Strangers who have left their families and tribes.” Sunan Ibn Majah 3988 - Book 36, Hadith 63",

So, some small mistakes are expected.

          "question": "So, should we follow the unanimous opinion of scholars in Islam even if a prominent scholar disagreed with them?",
          "answer": "Yes, the unanimous opinion or the opinion of the majority is safer for ordinary Muslims like us. It is very improbable that the majority of scholars will agree on something wrong. But it sometimes happens that one of the companions of the prophet or a prominent scholar has a weird ruling or a strange opinion which is different from the majority. So, yes, we should follow the unanimous opinion.\nCompanions of the prophet were very noble and righteous. However, they were humans. So, slight mistakes could happen. But, when they disagreed, it was not because of their lack of loyalty or faithfulness. Rather, it was because they disagreed in understanding some of prophet Muhammad's sayings. Or sometimes some of them did not hear the saying of the prophet.\nIn short, their disagreements were not about the basics of Islam.\nRather, they were about the small sections and branches. Also, their disagreements were limited and unintentional.",

          "question": "And what about women in Islam? I heard that Islam permits polygamy. That is, a man can marry up to 4 women at the same time. Isn't this a humiliation for women?",
          "answer": "Islam allowed a man to marry up to 4 women. This is true. But this is an honor to women not humiliation for the following reasons:\nPolygamy has got some benefits for nations. Some of these benefits are obvious. Others may not be clear for everyone because our minds and knowledge as humans are limited.\n1.\tMaking polygamy permissible honors women as Allah wanted a woman to be always sponsored by a man who is responsible for her, spends on her needs and protects her. Allah do not want a woman to be liable to working conditions and humiliation in society. He wanted her to be kept at home as a jewel and the man works hard and provides for her. And if a woman needs to work, she may be liable to problems and humiliation. Or she may resort to illegal jobs to provide for herself.\n2.\tIt is well-known that in many periods of history and nearly in all nations you can find the number of potential wives more than that of potential husbands. This is mainly because of major wars and civil wars which are usually an important reason behind the death of many young men. In addition, many men in every society are unwilling to get married for one reason or another. So, if you put all these factors into consideration, it will be unbalanced if we say that every man should take only one woman because in this case, you will find many women without a husband, especially, the divorced, the widowed and those who are not very attractive to men. Many women without a husband to protect them can be the reason for a lot of corruption in society.\n3.\tWhen Allah permitted polygamy for a man, He obliged him with many stipulations and responsibilities in order for this polygamy to be permissible. Firstly, he should be fair among his wives in overnight staying, expenses, intercourse and housing. It is also well-known that a man who has more than one wife always has a lot of responsibilities and he needs more expenses. So, in real life, especially in our age, you find that most men are satisfied with one wife only.\n4.\tIf you have a close look at so many countries around the world right now, you will find the widespread of adultery and illegal sexual relations, infidelity between couples, sharp increase in spinsterhood. Even worse, sexual abnormalities have spread to an unprecedented rate. These abnormalities have got two forms: men together or women together. It even went farther to the extent of making sexual relations with animals in many countries. In spite of all this pornography which is legally acceptable in many countries, the laws forbid polygamy. And in many countries in the world now you can have a girl-friend to have sex with her without any troubles or you can be homosexual and have a relation with a man like you. But if you want a second wife as Allah permit, it is forbidden by law.\nAs a result of these crooked and wicked laws, you can find hundreds of thousands of children who are of anonymous decent. That is, their real fathers are not known. Also, you can find some societies who are on the verge of distinction as a result of low marriage rates. Actually, this leads to the disintegration of society as the family is the first cornerstone of any society. Without families, we would be just a number of scavengers killing each other. And this is only a sample of the dangerous diseases which afflicted humanity as a result of not abiding by Allah's religious law.\n5.\tWe have to believe first that Allah the creator who made this verdict is all-knowing. He know exactly what makes us better. Also, we have to accept that there is righteousness and wisdom in this verdict even if we do not understand some of Allah's wisdom in this verdict.\nListen to this verse in Qur'an about polygamy:\n\"And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].\"\nAn Nisa – no. 4 – verse 3",

          "question": "But Islam also instructs a woman to stay in her house and to cover all her body. In addition, it gives a woman half of the inheritance it gives to a man. Is this fair?",
          "answer": "There isn't any religion or human law that honored women and gave them rights as Islam did. And here are some facts about how Islam honored the woman from her childhood to her old age:\n1.\twhen Allah instructed a woman to cover her body and stay at home except for necessity, he made this to protect her because she is a precious thing. Allah wanted her to be a queen in her house and her husband provides for her. He didn't want her to be humiliated by an employer or to be abused by wicked people or to be sexually harassed by villains. He didn't want her to be a low-priced item available everywhere for whoever can pay as she is now. Haven't you noticed that when international companies advertise their goods, there must be beautiful girls with tight clothes beside their goods?\nIsn't this a severe humiliation for her? To be abused as a beautiful body?\n2.\tIt is not true that a woman always inherits half of what a man inherits. This happens only when both of them are in the same level. For example, if a man died and left 2 boys and 3 girls. In this case, a woman inherits half of a man. This verdict must have a divine wisdom whether we understand it or not. One human explanation is that men need more money because they should set up a new house and provide for a wife and children. On the contrary, a woman is not required to do this, when a man comes to marry her, he is responsible to provide for her and her children.\n3.\tThere are many examples in jurisprudence when women inherit more than men. For instance, if a man dies and leaves 2 daughters but no sons or wife, the two daughters deserve two thirds of his property. However, his father deserves only one sixth of his property. There are many similar examples if you study the Islamic jurisprudence about inheritance\n4.\tAllah made the act of bringing up a girl and taking care of her a reason for entering paradise and escaping hellfire.\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Whoever supports two girls till they attain maturity, he and I will come on the Day of Resurrection like this\". Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) joined his fingers illustrating this.\nSahih Muslim: Arabic/English book reference : Book 1, Hadith 267\n5.\tThen when she gets married, Allah stated for her a big number of rights and honors that her husband should take care of. There is no room to mention all of them now, but here are few examples:\n( 2 ) And give to the orphans their properties and do not substitute the defective [of your own] for the good [of theirs]. And do not consume their properties into your own. Indeed, that is ever a great sin.\n( 3 ) And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].\n( 4 ) And give the women [upon marriage] their [bridal] gifts graciously. But if they give up willingly to you anything of it, then take it in satisfaction and ease.\nAl- Nisa'a – no. 4 – verses 2,3,4\n( 34 ) Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.\n( 35 ) And if you fear dissension between the two, send an arbitrator from his people and an arbitrator from her people. If they both desire reconciliation, Allah will cause it between them. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Acquainted [with all things].\nAl- Nisa'a – no. 4 – verses 34,35\n6.\tAllah canceled all the habits that oppressed women and deprived them of their rights before Islam. Even when a man hates his wife, Allah teaches him in Qur'an what to do:\n\"O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion. And do not make difficulties for them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.\"\nAl- Nisa'a – no. 4 – verse 19\n7 . Prophet Muhammad described the best people as those who deal with their wives in the best way.\nthe Prophet said: \"The best of you is the one who is best to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.\"\nSunan Ibn Majah 1977\nIn-book reference: Book 9, Hadith 133\nEnglish translation: Vol. 3, Book 9, Hadith 1977 Grade: Hasan\n8.\tProphet Muhammad in some of his travels was very careful about women who were carried by the camels that he instructed the boy who was guiding the camels to guide them slowly\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) came to some of his wives among whom there was Um Sulaim, and said, \"May Allah be merciful to you, O Anjasha! Drive the camels slowly, as they are carrying glass vessels!\" Abu Qalaba said, \"The Prophet (ﷺ) said a sentence (i.e. the above metaphor) which, had anyone of you said it, you would have admonished him for it\".\nSahih al-Bukhari 6149 : Book 78, Hadith 175 -\n9.\tAnd when she becomes a mother, Allah made her rights over her children the highest and the most important\nA man came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Your mother.\" The man said. \"Who is next?\" The Prophet said, \"Your mother.\" The man further said, \"Who is next?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Your mother.\" The man asked for the fourth time, \"Who is next?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Your father. \"\n: Sahih al-Bukhari 5971 : Book 78, Hadith 2",

          "question": "I also heard that prophet Muhammad married many women. Some people accuse him of being lustful and womanizer? What do you think?",
          "answer": "Let me explain to you:\n-\tProphet Muhammd has lived most of his young age from 25 to 50 with one woman only who was 15 years older than him \"Khadija Bint Khowaild\". And he was very young, and she has married before him. So, she was not virgin, but he kept faithful to her until her death.\n-\tHe then married another woman \"Sawda Bint Zama'a\". She was not virgin either. Also, she was almost five years older than the prophet (MPBUH). She was nearly 55 whereas he was fifty. and she remained his only wife for another 3 years. She was not that attractive or a highborn woman or even a rich one.\nThe prophet married her to soothe her as most of her family were still unbelievers and she had no one to take care of.\n-\tThen, he started polygamy with a divine order when he saw \"Aisha\" in his dream. The angel showed her to him wrapped in a cloth and told him: “This is your wife”. The dream was repeated and the prophet recognized that this was a divine order. \"Aisha\" was his first \"virgin wife\" and he was 53 at the time.\n-\tThen marriages came in a row. Most of them were from previously married women or widows and was for different reasons that supported the new religion or to make a new legislation.\n-\tFor example, his marriage to \" Zainab bint Gahsh\". This marriage was a heavenly order from Allah to make a new legislation for Muslims which cancels the habit of \"adoption\". Adoption meant that some people were taking some young boys as their real sons and giving them their names. Allah prohibited this in Islam. Prophet Muhammad himself adopted one boy whose name was \"Zaid Ibn Haritha\" before forbidding this by Allah. Zaid got married to \"Zainab Bint Gahsh\" and then they were divorced. Allah ordered his prophet to marry Zainab so that all Muslims understand that Zaid was no more the son of Prophet Muhammad and the prophet can marry Zaid's divorcee without any embarrassment. This happened at a time when Arab Muslims did not allow anyone to marry the divorcee of his adopted son. So, Allah made this marriage to eradicate the habit of adoption in the Muslim society. Allah narrated this incident in Qur'an:\n\"And [remember, O Muhammad], when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor, \"Keep your wife and fear Allah,\" while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose. And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him. So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command of Allah accomplished.\nAl Ahzab – no. 33 – verse 37\n-\tAnother example is when he married \"Safiyya Bint Huyay Ibn Akhtab\" because she was the daughter of a tribe's leader who were defeated in war and she was taken as captive.\nSomeone from the companions told the prophet that \"She is\nonly suitable for you messenger of Allah\" when one of the Muslims wanted her for himself. He wanted to give her due respect as the daughter of a leader and at the same time urge her tribe to embrace Islam.\n-\tOther marriages were for the sake of tightening the relation between him and some of his close companions and pleasing them as in the case of \"Hafsa\" the daughter of Omar Ibn El- Khattab.\n-\tAlso, there are clear benefits in the prophet's several marriages in that these wives were an important tool to transfer the details of fiqh and Islamic legislation to other Muslim women. If it was one wife, she would not be able to discern and transfer all the prophetic and heavenly knowledge that need to be spread among the Muslim nation especially women.\n-\tProphet Muhammad's stipend that was allocated for his wives’ expenses was very little to the extent that his wives once gathered and asked him to increase their stipends. At this time, the prophet kept himself away from them for one month and waited for divine inspiration. Then, Allah gave them the choice in Qur'an: either to be patient and accept a very little stipend with the prophet in return for unimaginable rewards from Allah in the last Day or to be divorced and be given their dowry peacefully. All his wives later chose to remain with the prophet and be patient. Actually, they chose \"paradise\". Allah narrated this incident in Qur'an when He gave the prophets' wives the option to choose for themselves.\n\"O Prophet, say to your wives, \"If you should desire the worldly life and its adornment, then come, I will provide for you and give you a gracious release. But if you should desire Allah and His Messenger and the home of the Hereafter - then indeed, Allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward.\"\nAl Ahzab– no.33 – verse 28 ,29\n-\t. Definitely, the prophet could have been very rich and give his wives a large pocket money if he wanted as Allah made for him one fifth of the war spoils. But he gave everything to the poor and kept very little for himself. Allah wanted the prophet and his wives to be an example for every Muslim in the simple and humble way of living.\nOnce his wife \"Aisha said Narrated `Aisha:\nthat she said to `Urawa, \"O, the son of my sister! We used to see three crescents in two months, and no fire used to be made in the houses of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (i.e. nothing used to be cooked).\" `Urwa said, \"What used to sustain you?\" `Aisha said, \"The two black things i.e., dates and water, except that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had neighbors from the Ansar who had some she-camels, and they used to give the Prophet (ﷺ) some milk from their house, and he used to make us drink it.\"\nSahih al-Bukhari 6459 - Book 81, Hadith 48\n-\tCan you imagine a family living for two months or three in a row without cooking one meal in their house? It was only dates and water. So, could any lustful person who liked this life and its pleasures live like this?\n-\tIf the prophet was lustful as some unbelievers accuse him, he would have married virgins and in young age to enjoy himself. Also, he would have spent a lot on his wives to enjoy everything in this life, but he was a prophet. And he was very ascetic in worldly pleasures.",

          "question": "And what about Islam's stance on money? I heard that Islam prohibits interest and consequently prohibits most of the modern banking transactions? Is this true? How can we get along with the current world financial system if we are Muslims?",
          "answer": "Islam prohibited interest because it is the root of much evil in this world. Most of the bankers’ business is merely as “brokerage of interest”. They take money from depositors with a low interest, lend it to businessmen with a high interest. Then, the bankers take the difference as their profit. This is simply the main business of banks. As a direct result of this, the paper money increases dramatically without real production. And people are tempted to put their money in banks to take easy profit instead of making projects which create jobs and develop the economy. This incurs many disasters like inflation, unemployment, high prices…. etc.\nHave a look at the economy of countries around you. You will find that there is a clear relation between high interest rates and inflation, high prices, unemployment and recession. On the other hand, you will find an obvious correlation between low-rate interests and economic boom, high rate of employment and stable prices.\nThis is a clear proof that interest is evil. It is against sound economies and healthy societies.\nTo be a true Muslim, you should avoid all banking transactions that include interest rates as usury is one of the terrible sins in Islam. Refer to economic news during the last 5 years to make sure that some of the developed countries with advanced technologies and a very strong economy had decided to decrease the rate of interest until it reached zero. Further, they made it minus. That is, if you deposit money in the bank, you will have to pay money for the bank to keep your money in it instead of taking profit.\nWhat do you think will be the result of this? Definitely, people will refrain from depositing their money in banks. Instead, they will try to make investments. These investments will create jobs, increase sales and eventually develop the economy. Allah prohibited interest because it devastates the economies, spreads corruption, increases\nprices and encourages people to stay at home, wait for easy profits and be jobless.\nThe following verses warn people against interest and usury:\n( 275 ) Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, \"Trade is [just] like interest.\" But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah. But whoever returns to [dealing in interest or usury] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein.\nAl-Baqara – no. 2 – verse 275\n( 278 ) O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.\n( 279 ) And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal - [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged.\nAl-Baqara – no. 2 – verse 278 – 279",

          "question": "I heard that Islam is against science, technology and development. Is this true?",
          "answer": "It is 100 % wrong. Islam urges all Muslims to think, look at the miracles in the earth and the universe and in themselves and their creation. There are many Qur'an verses about this.\n( 17 ) Then do they not look at the camels - how they are created? ( 18 ) And at the sky - how it is raised?\n( 19 ) And at the mountains - how they are erected?\n20 ) And at the earth - how it is spread out?\nAl Ghashiyah – no.88 – verse 17 – 20\nEven the first ever order in Qur'an was “Recite\" or \"Read\"\n( 1 ) Recite in the name of your Lord who created - ( 2 ) Created man from a clinging substance.\n( 3 ) Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous - ( 4 ) Who taught by the pen -\n( 5 ) Taught man that which he knew not.\nAl 'Alaq – no. 96 – verse 1 – 5\n\"\tand say, \"My Lord, increase me in knowledge.\"\nTa Ha – no.20 – verse 114\nSay, \"Are those who know and those who do not know equal?\" Only those possessed of reason will remember.\nAz Zumar – no. 39 – verse 9\nEven more, Allah give reverence and commendation to those who have knowledge\n\"\tAllah will raise those who have believed among you and\nthose who were given knowledge, by degrees. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do.\nAl Mujadilah – no. 58 – verse 11\nIn addition, Qura'n includes many verses with scientific allusions and hints. These are only few of them:\n( 30 ) Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?\nAl Anbiya\" – no. 21 – verse 30\n( 31 ) And We placed within the earth firmly set mountains, lest it should shift with them, and We made therein [mountain] passes [as] roads that they might be guided.\n( 32 ) And We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs, are turning away.\nAl Anbiya\" – no. 21 – verse 31 – 32\n( 27 ) Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky, and We produce thereby fruits of varying colors? And in the mountains are tracts, white and red of varying shades and [some] extremely black.\n( 28 ) And among people and moving creatures and grazing livestock are various colors similarly. Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Forgiving.\nFatir – no.35 – verse 27 – 28\nYou can refer to Qur’an if you need to read more verses that refer to Science. Qura’n is not meant to be a science book. It is primarily a divine book to teach people the true religion and the true belief. However, it had many verses that has scientific denotations and connotations to show people the powers of Allah and to urge them to think about His innumerable blessings upon people.",

          "question": "I heard that Islam is against being rich or making business. It recommends for a Muslim to lead a poor and simple life. Is this true?",
          "answer": "No, it is totally wrong. If all Muslims were to be poor, then they would be enslaved by the unbelievers. Money is very important in life. Islam does not prohibit or discourage being rich as long as you are paying your zakat and sadakat to the poor. Allah want the money to be in your hand, not in your heart. He want you to use the money for your own benefit and your family's benefit and your community's benefit as well. And He warn people against accumulating money and making treasures because the main benefit of money in Islam is to circulate in society.\nWhen money circulates by making businesses, creating jobs, giving salaries and offering services and products, the society becomes healthy and economically strong and vice versa.\nEven, another way of money circulation is privileged in Islam. That is, giving an amount of money to the poor so that the people who\nare unable to earn money for one reason or another are protected in society and at the same time, the rich are protected against the poor people’s envy and evil.\nIn short, it is not bad in Islam to be rich, but it is very dangerous on your destiny if you accumulate money greedily. Allah warn these people in some verses of Qur'an:\n34 ……And those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the\nway of Allah - give them tidings of a painful punishment.\n( 35 ) The Day when it will be heated in the fire of Hell and seared therewith will be their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, [it will be said], \"This is what you hoarded for yourselves, so taste what you used to hoard.\"\nAt Tawbah – no.9 – verse 34 – 35\n( 15 ) No! Indeed, it is the Flame [of Hell], ( 16 ) A remover of exteriors.\n( 17 ) It invites he who turned his back [on truth] and went away [from obedience]\n( 18 ) And collected [wealth] and hoarded.\nAl Ma'arij – no. 70 – verse 15 – 18",

          "answer": "Yes, marriage is the only acceptable way of making a sexual relationship in Islam, but this is surely for the benefit and welfare of all people. By forbidding adultery and fornication, Allah wanted to save and protect the Muslim society. When illegal sexual relations spread in a society, this society is destroyed gradually. Even more,\nthe society dwindles and fades bit by bit. In addition, dangerous incurable diseases become epidemic.\nIn fact, homosexuality and lesbianism are big atrocities in Islam. They are an utter distortion of Allah's creation and a stoppage to the natural reproduction of the human race. Allah warned any people who accept and legalize these actions in their societies with torment, torture and destruction in this life and the Hereafter.\nAt the same time, Allah permitted legal marriage and advocated it. Even for those who need more than one wife for one reason or another, Allah granted them this right, but obliged them with fairness and many duties in return so that the wives’ rights can be protected in polygamy against any unfair practices by men.",

          "question": "Why didn’t Allah enable us to see Him, see paradise and hellfire with our own eyes in this life? Maybe most people would be believers in this case?",
          "answer": "To start with, it is Allah’s destiny that He, Almighty, Eternal Paradise and Eternal Hellfire are unseen for us in our earthly life. So, Allah’s laws can never be discussed, but we still can think to understand some of His wisdom behind this or that law.\nIf we could see all the unseen, Allah, Paradise and hellfire with our own eyes, the test would be meaningless. Allah preordained that we should believe in the unseen in this life in order to be true believers.\nOn the day of Resurrection, people will see the unseen and all of them will believe. But their belief will not be beneficial to them at that time. This verse describes this decisive moment when the unbelievers are presented to the Hellfire and they hope to get back to life in order to be believers.\n( 27 ) If you could but see when they are made to stand before the Fire and will say, \"Oh, would that we could be returned [to life on earth] and not deny the signs of our Lord and be among the believers.\"\nAl An'am – no.6 – verse 27\n( 12 ) Indeed, those who fear their Lord unseen will have forgiveness and great reward.\nAl Mulk – no. 67 – verse 12\n( 3 )\tWho believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them,\nAl Baqarah – no.2 – verse 3\nWhen Prophet Muhammad was asked about \"Faith\"\n\"Inform me about Iman (faith).\" He (the Prophet) answered, \"It is that you believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Messengers and in the Last Day, and in fate (qadar), both in its good and in its evil aspects.\"\n40 Hadith Nawawi 2 - Hadith 2\nIt is obvious that all the elements of “Iman” or “Faith” mentioned by Prophet Muhammad in the previous “Hadeeth” are elements of the “Unseen”. So, in short, the Islamic belief is based on believing what you cannot see with your eyes. The lexical meaning of the word “Iman” itself means to believe something you did not see with your eyes.\nIn short, Allah’s big test for people in this life is based on this kind of\nbelief. To believe in the unseen that Allah had told us about.",

          "question": "If prophet Muhammad was a prophet to all humanity, then what about other nations and people who lived before prophet Muhammad?",
          "answer": "Prophet Muhammad was sent to humanity from his time to the Last Day. But, Allah sent prophets and messengers to every nation since the beginning of history until the time of Prophet Muhammad. All these prophets and messengers came to their nations with the same message: \"Worship and obey Allah and his messengers in every detail of your life. Believe in the Last Day and Eternal Paradise and Eternal Hellfire\".\nWhen it was the time of Prophet Muhammad, he also came with the same message that all his predecessors came with. The only difference was the way Allah should be worshipped and some other legislations that are suitable for every nation and every age.\nAllah decreed that it was the right time to send one prophet to all\nhumanity. Definitely, Allah has His own wisdom in doing this whether we discern it or not.\nAllah will not ask us about these previous nations and what they did. Only Allah know everything about them and will evaluate them accordingly. We will be evaluated according to our own deeds only. Allah is fair enough.\nThese facts are mentioned in many Qur’anic verses:\n\" That was a nation which has passed on. It will have [the consequence of] what it earned, and you will have what you have earned. And you will not be asked about what they used to do.\"\nAl Baqarah– no. – verse 134\n\"Whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul. And whoever errs only errs against it. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And never would We punish until We sent a messenger.\"\nAl Isra – no. 17 – verse 15\n\"Indeed, We have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner.

          "question": "And how did these nations react to their prophets' messages? Did they believe and follow them?",
          "answer": "In fact, most of the nations mentioned in Qur’an belied, disobeyed and betrayed their prophets. Some people believed but they were a few in every nation. Allah destroyed and obliterated all the unbelievers; generation after generation. For Allah created people mainly to worship Him. And if they do not, He eradicate them at the time He want.\nThese facts are mentioned in Qur’an in many verses:\n\"And We had already destroyed generations before you when they wronged, and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs, but they were not to believe. Thus, do We recompense the criminal people.\"\nYunus – no. 10 – verse 13\n\"And how many have We destroyed from the generations after Noah. And sufficient is your Lord, concerning the sins of His servants, as Acquainted and Seeing.\"\nAl Isra – no. 17 – verse 17\n\"And how many have We destroyed before them of generations? Do you perceive of them anyone or hear from them a sound?\"\nMaryam – no.19 – verse 98\n\" But none had believed with him, except a few.\"\nHud – No.11 - verse 40\nThe previous verse is speaking about Prophet Noah and his people.\n\"Similarly, there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said, \"A magician or a madman. Did they suggest it to them? Rather, they [themselves] are a transgressing people. So leave them, [O Muhammad], for you are not to be blamed. And remind, for indeed, the reminder benefits the believers. And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me. I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed Me.\nIndeed, it is Allah who is the [continual] Provider, the firm possessor of strength.\"\nAdh Dhariyat– no. 51 – verse 52 – 58",

          "question": "But why did most people in other nations refuse the message of their prophets to believe in their creator and obey Him?",
          "answer": "One of the main reasons for this was arrogance. Some of them were bragging about their fortunes. Others were boasting about their powers and abilities. Others preferred to follow their unbeliever ancestors blindly. And others were so arrogant that they refused to be equivalent to the poor people. But, they forgot, foolishly, that their powers and fortunes were blessings from Allah. Blessings that could be deprived at any time by the commands of Allah and without any prior notice.\nAnother major reason was their disbelief in the resurrection and the Last Day. They couldn’t figure out the simple fact that the one who created them the first time is, surely, able to resurrect them again easily after death.\nQur’an talks about these different reasons repeatedly:\n\"And they rejected them, while their [inner] selves were convinced thereof, out of injustice and haughtiness. So, see how was the end of the corrupters.\"\nAn Naml– no.27 – verse 14\n\"[Due to] arrogance in the land and plotting of evil; but the evil plot does not encompass except its own people. Then do they await except the way of the former peoples? But you will never find in the way of Allah any change, and you will never find in the way of Allah any alteration.\"\nFatir – no.35 – verse 43\n\"And similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said, \"Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following.\"\nAz Zukhruf– no. 43 – verse 23\n\"And they said, \"We are more [than the believers] in wealth and children, and we are not to be punished.\"\nSaba – no.34 – verse 35\n\"And they said, \"Our hearts are wrapped.\" But, [in fact], Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is it that they believe.\"\nAl Baqarah- no.2 – verse 88",

          "question": "Why were many of Allah's messengers and Prophets from the Middle East, the Arab Peninsula, Iraq, Syria and Palestine?",
          "answer": "Not all of them were from the Middle East, but maybe the most prominent of them were. Surely, Allah has His wisdom in doing this. Maybe this area was the heart of the world at that time. So, it was more qualified to be the starting point for spreading Allah's messages. Maybe because of the nature of people living in this area. Maybe other reasons. Anyway, it is Allah's choice.\nDefinitely, the prophets who are mentioned in the Torah, the Gospel and Qur'an are not all the prophets of Allah to humanity in all ages. The ones mentioned are only a small number. These are the ones Allah wanted to tell us about. But surely, there are many other prophets- unknown to us- who were sent to peoples in islands, far-away countries and deserted places in different ages. So, not all of Allah's prophets are from the Middle East\nAllah say these facts briefly in Qur'an:\n( 78 ) And We have already sent messengers before you. Among them are those [whose stories] We have related to you, and among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to you. And it was not for any messenger to bring a sign [or verse] except by permission of Allah. So when the command of Allah comes, it will be concluded in truth, and the falsifiers will thereupon lose [all].\nGhafir – no. 40 – verse 78\nSo, prophets are so many. We know a number of them. Many of them are not mentioned in the Divine revelations. Allah state that He had sent a prophet in each single nation along human history.\n( 24 ) Indeed, We have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And there was no nation but that there had passed within it a warner.\nFatir – no.35 – verse 24",

          "question": "But some people become more wealthy and powerful as they become more corrupt and atheist. Isn't this surprising?",
          "answer": "Yes, this is true, but it is not surprising when one remembers the most fundamental law of this worldly life: testing. This life was created as a place of trial, not as the final destination. The real and eternal life is the Hereafter.\n\nBecause this life is a test, its outcomes are not based on justice alone. As a result, one may see righteous and pious people oppressed, tortured, or even killed, while tyrannical, arrogant, and unbelieving individuals enjoy wealth, health, power, and long lives.\n\nAllah gives everyone sufficient time to complete their test in full, because there will be no second chance, no retesting, and no repetition on the Day of Judgment. Every soul will face the consequences of its choices with absolute justice in the Hereafter.\n\nAt times, Allah may even increase the wealth and power of arrogant and corrupt people, not as a sign of His pleasure, but as a form of gradual misguidance. Their arrogance grows, their sins increase, and thus their punishment in the Hereafter becomes complete and fully deserved. This is part of Allah’s wisdom and justice.\n\nThis profound reality is mentioned repeatedly in the Qur'an.\n\nAllah says:\n\n\"But those who deny Our signs – We will progressively lead them [to destruction] from where they do not know. And I will give them time. Indeed, My plan is firm.\"\nAl-A‘raf – no. 7 – verses 182–183\n\nAllah also clarifies that worldly wealth has no real value compared to the Hereafter:\n\n\"And if it were not that the people would become one community [of disbelievers], We would have made for those who disbelieve in the Most Merciful – for their houses – ceilings and stairways of silver upon which to mount, and for their houses – doors and couches [of silver] upon which to recline, and gold ornaments. But all that is nothing but the enjoyment of worldly life. And the Hereafter with your Lord is for the righteous.\"\nAz-Zukhruf – no. 43 – verses 33–35\n\nAllah further exposes the false assumption that wealth and children are signs of divine approval:\n\n\"And indeed this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so fear Me. But the people divided their religion among them into sects – each faction rejoicing in what it has. So leave them in their confusion for a time. Do they think that what We extend to them of wealth and children is because We hasten for them good things? Rather, they do not perceive.\"\nAl-Mu’minun – no. 23 – verses 52–56\n\nTherefore, wealth, power, and worldly success are not indicators of truth, righteousness, or divine pleasure. They are part of the test. True success is measured in faith, obedience, patience, and the final outcome on the Day of Resurrection.",

          "answer": "\n( 7 ) It is He who has sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific. As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them].\nAnd no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, \"We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.\" And no one will be reminded except those of understanding.\nAl 'Imran– no. 3 – verse 7\nAs the verse states, some of the Quranic verses are specific and precise so that everyone can understand even the illiterate and very simple people. Those are the verses that talk about the qualities of Allah, our creator and why we were created and what waits for us after this life. These verses about the basic beliefs are very precise because they are the basics of the book and the basics of Islam. The other kind of verses is \"unspecific\". Their real meanings are only known by Allah and- may be - some of the knowledgeable scholars. But those who have deviation and corruption in their hearts always focus on these \"unspecific\" verses and try to interpret them as they like because they are inherently corrupt and they do not want to follow the right way.\nQur'an is the word of Allah. It is miraculous in every aspect. It is intended to be a miracle for people in every age and in every culture. So, if all the Qur'anic verses had specific and clear meanings as you said, the miraculous aspects would disappear. Some verses should be ambiguous for some people in every age so that the miracle will continue to the last day of this world.\nAnd they ask you, [O Muhammad], about the soul.

          "question": "But some verses in this Qur'an are similar or confusing and scholars did not agree about some verdicts. What should Muslims do about this?",
          "answer": "The sources of legislation in Islam are four: They are respectively: Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus of Islamic scholars and comparing known incidents to new incidents using tools of Islamic legislation. So, for example, if a scholar is trying to find an Islamic ruling for any incident, he will search Qura'n first. If he did not find in Qur'an, he will search in Sunnah. If he did not find in sunnah, he will check if there is any consensus about this case among scholars. If he didn't find a consensus, he should compare the new incident to old ones using specific tools of legislation and fiqh.\nSo, in short, an ordinary Muslim. That is, a Muslim who is not a scholar should always ask scholars about the right ruling in Islam for a specific case or the meaning of a specific verse. On the other hand, if a Muslim is a scholar, or at least has the right skills and tools to search for the right ruling, he can count on himself in doing this, especially that nowadays information is available on websites, applications and printed books.\nAllah instructed us in Qur’an to ask the knowledgeable people if\nwe do not know.\n\"( 43 ) And We sent not before you except men to whom We revealed [Our message].

For example, Allah like for all his creatures to be believers and enter paradise and avoid hellfire and live happily in this life and the Hereafter. But, he destiny on many of them to be unbelievers and suffer in this life and the Hereafter. Allah do not like this bad destiny for them but He doomed it for them because He know – as He is All- knowing- they deserve it because they did not believe in Him and did not follow his Messengers. Allah granted everyone the free choice and to be a believer or unbeliever and they chose the dark way. So, they deserved Allah's destiny. And remember that Allah is all-fair. And he has no advantage in making these specific people unbelievers or those specific people believers. But they choose freely for themselves during their lives and Allah destiny them what they choose.",

          "answer": "Allah is all-fair. He do not need to oppress any of his creatures. He gave every one an even chance to be a believer or unbeliever.\nAnd Allah knew that unbelievers would make this allegation. So, he answered them in Qur'an a long time ago and He asked them to prove their allegations if they could:\n( 148 ) Those who associated with Allah will say, \"If Allah had willed, we would not have associated [anything] and neither would our fathers, nor would we have prohibited anything.\" Likewise, did those before deny until they tasted Our punishment. Say, \"Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow not except assumption, and you are not but falsifying.\"\nAl An'am – No. 6 – verse 148\nThen Allah unfolded to them what He did with their souls to implant monotheism in their inherent natures before he had created their bodies. Definitely, this act was fair enough for everyone. Allah implanted the seed of monotheism in every human before he or she was born. Then, during his or her life on Earth, they had the free will to make their choices. Of course, the details of these processes and how they were done is known only by Allah.\n( 172 ) And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said, \"Yes, we have testified.\" [This] - lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, \"Indeed, we were of this unaware.\"\n( 173 ) Or [lest] you say, \"It was only that our fathers associated [others in worship] with Allah before, and we were but descendants after them.

          "question": "How should Muslims deal with unfair and cruel rulers, kings or presidents? What is Islam's stance about this?",
          "answer": "I think it is not wise or proper to demonstrate or challenge with force against unfair rulers, kings or presidents because this will result in more misery, more slaying, more chaos and more weakness and poverty for any nation.\nSome people think that if they demonstrate against that president or this king and force him out of office in one way or another, everything will change and justice will prevail but this is totally untrue because corruption is not usually the product of one person. It is often the product of a whole system. The leader or the politician is only the tip of the iceberg. If you remove the tip, the iceberg is still there under the water unseen and much more dangerous than the tip you removed. The iceberg will develop scores of tips of the same kind.\nIn other words, even if you succeed in getting rid of the alleged corrupt leader, the system that produced this or that leader and supported him is still there and it will produce similar leaders with new names and faces. And the system itself consists of people from this society. So, The system and the people are somewhat related.\nIn fact, there is no fast or magical way to get rid of the corruption and deviation of the political leaders and systems. The only correct and safe way is to be pious and obey Allah sincerely and bring up your children in a good way. This will change our rulers to better ones on the long run.\nThis kind of change can be done on the long run only. However, it can never be done in elections or coups because the corrupt system produces different names with the same corruption. And it always protects its men from under the table. It will be very dangerous to risk challenging the system. This may result in civil wars, unrest and more corruption and misery. And this happened repeatedly throughout history. We should start with ourselves, correct our lives, and correct our relation with our creator and with people. Moreover, we should bring up our children well and be patient. Change will come if we do this. Definitely, it will come but it will come slowly.\nSadly, the bad and corrupt rulers may be a punishment from Allah to a corrupt society. So, returning back to your religion and to your creator and repenting is the best possible way on the long run.\nAnd here are lots of evidence from Qur’an and Sunnah about obeying the leaders even if they were unfair:\n( 59 ) O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best [way] and best in result.\nAn Nisa – no.4 – verse 59\nWa'il bin Hujr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:\nSalamah bin Yazid Al-Ju'f (May Allah be pleased with him) asked Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): \"O Prophet of Allah! Tell us, what you command us to do if there arises over us rulers who demand of us what is due to them and refuse us what is due to us.\" Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned away from him, but he repeated the same question. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Listen to them and obey them. They are responsible for their obligations and you are accountable\tfor\tyours.\"\n[Muslim]. Book 1 – Hadeeth 669\nNarrated `Abdullah:\nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to us, \"You will see after me, selfishness (on the part of other people) and other matters that you will disapprove of.\" They asked, \"What do you order us to do, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? (under such circumstances)?\" He said, \"Pay their rights to them (to the rulers) and ask your right from Allah.\"\nSahih al-Bukhari 7052 - Book 92, Hadith 5\nNarrated Ibn `Abbas:\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Whoever disapproves of something done by his ruler then he should be patient, for whoever disobeys the ruler even a little (little = a span) will die as those who died in the Pre- lslamic Period of Ignorance. (i.e. as rebellious Sinners).\nSahih al-Bukhari 7053 - Book 92, Hadith 6\nAnas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Hear and obey even if an Abyssinian slave whose head is like a raisin is placed in authority over you.\"\n[Al- Bukhari] – Book 1 – Hadeeth 666",

          "question": "And what does Islam say about the great disparity among people in wealth and property in this life? Some people do not find their daily meals while others own billions.",
          "answer": "Qur’an answered this question very clearly and expressed amazement at the people who challenge the wisdom and power of Allah and ask: “Why did He give this person? “Why did he deprive that one?\n\"( 62 ) Allah extends provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts for him. Indeed, Allah is, of all things, Knowing.\"\nAl 'Ankabut– no. 29 – verse 62\nHere are some logical reasons for not making everyone rich. They are mentioned clearly in Qur’an:\n\"( 32 ) Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord? It is We who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees [of rank] that they may make use of one another for service. But the mercy of your Lord is better than whatever they accumulate.\"\nAz Zukhruf– no. 43 – verse 32\n\"( 27 ) And if Allah had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth. But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills. Indeed, He is, of His servants, Acquainted and Seeing.\"\nAsh-Shura– no. 42 – verse 27\nIn the first verse, Allah inform us that the disparity in wealth and fortunes among people is very necessary for the economies to survive. In other words, every economy needs the poor people who are usually workers and the middle people who are usually employees or small entrepreneurs and the rich people who are usually the large investors. It is common sense that in any project, you need the three types of people. And it is unimaginable and unrealistic to think of a society of rich people only. Who would be the workers and employees, then? Or to imagine a society of poor people only. Who would invest in projects and recruit them, then?\nIn the second verse, Allah explain that if He extended wealth excessively to His servants, they would be tyrannous and oppression will prevail.",

          "question": "Are you sure the creator is just and fair 100% with all of us in spite of the great disparities in wealth, health, life span, fortunes, destiny and everything? How can He be fair with everyone in spite of the great disparities among people in everything? Give me evidence.",
          "answer": "Logically, the creator of this universe with billions of creatures and humans must be fair. Being fair needs someone to be: self-sufficient, all-knowing, all- powerful and unbiased. And because humans usually lack all these qualities, they are usually unfair with one another. But Allah is completely different. Allah has all the super qualities of knowledge, power, self-sufficiency. Actually, He do not need to be unfair. And if he is unfair, his injustice would be too hard to bear because He is all-powerful.\nLife in this world and the disparity among people in wealth, health and power are not an accurate measurement at all because Allah stated in many Quranic verses that life for him is nothing and that He may give the unbelievers a lot of wealth and health in this life.\nHowever, believers may be poor and sick. It is all a big test.\nThese facts are stated in Qur'an in different verses:\n( 40 ) Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.\nAn Nisa – no. 4 – verse 40\n( 44 ) Indeed, Allah does not wrong the people at all, but it is the people who are wronging themselves.\nYunus – no. 10 – verse 44\n( 22 ) And Allah created the heavens and earth in truth and so that every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.\nAl Jathiyah – No. 45 – verse 22\n( 49 ) And the record [of deeds] will be placed [open], and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it, and they will say, \"Oh, woe to us! What is this book that leaves nothing small or great except\nthat it has enumerated it?\" And they will find what they did present [before them]. And your Lord does injustice to no one.\nAl Kahf– no.18 – verse 49\n( 55 ) Do they think that what We extend to them of wealth and children\n( 56 ) Is [because] We hasten for them good things? Rather, they do not perceive.\nAl Mu\"minun– no. 23 – verses 55 –56\n( 44 ) So leave Me, [O Muhammad], with [the matter of] whoever denies the Qur'an. We will progressively lead them [to punishment] from where they do not know.\n( 45 ) And I will give them time. Indeed, My plan is firm.\nAl Qalam– no.68 – verse 44 – 45\nAll the previous verses state that Allah may give the unbelievers in this life much wealth, health and power only to lead them progressively to the eternal punishment they deserve because they were blind about his signs and his messengers.\nSo, a lot of blessings do not mean that Allah love you. On the contrary, many calamities do not mean that Allah hate you. Simply Allah is testing everyone with which is suitable for His servant.",

And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned.\nAl Anbiya\" – no. 21 – verse 35\nSo, if trial or testing was the main target, it is very logical that Allah create Satan and kinds of evil in this life. In order to have a test, there should be a struggle. And in order to have a struggle, there must be good and evil. If only good and righteousness existed on Earth, the test or trial would be meaningless.\nOriginally, Satan was a pious worshipper to Allah. And when Allah created Adam, He asked all angels to prostrate to Adam. All angels obeyed Allah except Satan. Allah asked him why he did not obey the order.\nAllah tell us the full story in the following verses:\n( 32 ) [Allah] said, O Iblees, what is [the matter] with you that you are not with those who prostrate?\"\n( 34 ) [Allah] said, \"Then get out of it, for indeed, you are expelled.\n( 36 ) He said, \"My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected.\"\n( 37 ) [Allah] said, \"So indeed, you are of those reprieved\t ( 38 ) Until the Day of the time well-known.\"\n( 39 ) [Iblees] said, \"My Lord, because You have put me in error, I will surely make [disobedience] attractive to them on earth, and I will mislead them all\n( 40 ) Except, among them, Your chosen servants.\"\n( 41 ) [Allah] said, \"This is a path [of return] to Me [that is] straight. ( 42 ) Indeed, My servants - no authority will you have over them, except those who follow you of the deviators.\n( 43 ) And indeed, Hell is the promised place for them all.\t ( 44 ) It has seven gates; for every gate is of them a portion designated.\"",

          "question": "But many people were born in unbeliever families, not Muslims and in countries far away from Islam? Or they had no idea about the true religion. How will these people be evaluated?",
          "answer": "Allah made the sound belief of monotheism inherent in all human beings. It is an uncorrupted concept inherent in everyone that there is a creator for this world whom we have to obey when we are born. So, all human beings around the globe are born with this sound and uncorrupted instinct that we have to believe in the creator of this world and obey him. But, then, his parents make him a Jew or a Christian or any other religion when he grows up. Still, the true guidance or the heavenly compass is still inside him which always tell him: \"There is a creator for this world. And the creator want you to be a Muslim. Allah gave him the choice to follow his inherent true instinct or his fathers' and grandfathers' belief and he will be accounted for his choice of course.\nThe following verses and hadeeth explain these facts:\n\"( 172 ) And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said, \"Yes, we have testified.\" [This] - lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, \"Indeed, we were of this unaware.\"\n( 173 ) Or [lest] you say, \"It was only that our fathers associated [others in worship] with Allah before, and we were but descendants after them. Then would You destroy us for what the falsifiers have done?\"\n( 174 ) And thus do We [explain in] detail the verses, and perhaps they will return.\"\nAl A'raf– no. 7 – verse 172 – 174\nNarrated Abu Huraira:\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Every child is born with a true faith of Islam (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone) and his parents convert him to Judaism or Christianity or Magianism, as an animal delivers a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?\"\nSahih al-Bukhari 1385\nIn-book reference: Book 23, Hadith 137\nStill, we have a problem. What if someone has never heard about Islam throughout his life? The assumption is improbable. But let’s assume it could happen. In this case, Allah know what this person would have done if he heard about Islam. Allah will never oppress him surely. Allah has His own way of doing justice with his servants.\nThe following hadeeth answers this question:\nNarrated Abu Huraira:\nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"No child is born but has the Islamic Faith, but its parents turn it into a Jew or a Christian. It is as you help the animals give birth. Do you find among their offspring a mutilated one before you mutilate them yourself?\" The people said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What do you think about those (of them) who die young?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Allah knows what they would have done (were they to live).\"\nSahih al-Bukhari 6599, 6600\nIn-book reference: Book 82, Hadith 6",

          "question": "But I saw many Muslims around the world who were dishonest and liars. I saw other Muslims who were corrupt and villains. How do you explain that?",
          "answer": "Yes, this kind of people is really there everywhere. These people are not real Muslims. Islam is not by what is written in your ID. Islam is what you believe and what you practice in your everyday life.\nMany people are only Muslims by their ID, but they do not follow the teachings of Islam or their prophet's Sunnah. Do not judge Islam by these hypocrites. You should evaluate Islam by the basics and the regulations of Islam. Moreover, people are getting more corrupt as the time passes forward up to the Last Day. This means that corruption and corrupted people are on the rise. This is a bitter fact we have to admit and adapt to. Actually, it is part of the big test we have to undergo in this life that we should live and deal with lots of hypocrites and corrupt people.\nThere are many verses and Hadeeths that talk about this issue:\n( 41 ) Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned so He may let them taste part of [the consequence of] what they have done that perhaps they will return [to righteousness].\nAr Rum – no. 30 – verse 41\nIbn 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:\nYou would find people like one hundred camels and you would not find even one (camel) fit for riding.\nSahih Muslim 2547\nBook 44, Hadith 328\nBook 31, Hadith 6179\nExplanation: The hadeeth refers to the rarity of true good people whom you can accompany or befriend. The prophet (MPBUH) compared the righteous and honest people whom you can trust to the camel that is fit for riding which is very rare among other camels.\nNarrated Hudhaifa:\nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) narrated to us two narrations, one of which I have seen (happening) and I am waiting for the other. He narrated that honesty was preserved in the roots of the hearts of men (in the beginning) and then they learnt it (honesty) from the Qur'an, and then they learnt it from the (Prophet's) Sunna (tradition). He also told us about its disappearance, saying, \"A man will go to sleep whereupon honesty will be taken away from his heart, and only its trace will remain, resembling the traces of fire. He then will sleep whereupon the remainder of the honesty will also be taken away (from his heart) and its trace will resemble a blister which is raised over the surface of skin, when an ember touches one's foot; and in fact, this blister does not contain anything. So there will come a day when people will deal in business with each other but there will hardly be any trustworthy persons among them. Then it will be said that in such- and-such a tribe there is such-and-such person who is honest, and a man will be admired for his intelligence, good manners and strength, though indeed he will not have belief equal to a mustard seed in his heart.\" The narrator added: There came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his religion would prevent him from cheating; and if he was a Christian, his Muslim ruler would prevent him from cheating; but today I cannot deal except with so-and-so and so-and-so. (See Hadith No. 208, Vol. 9)\nSahih al-Bukhari 6497\nBook 81, Hadith 86\nVol. 8, Book 76, Hadith 504\nNarrated `Imran bin Husain:\n\"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'The best of my followers are those living in my generation (i.e. my contemporaries). and then those who will follow the latter\" `Imran added, \"I do not remember whether he mentioned two or three generations after his generation, then the Prophet (ﷺ) added, 'There will come after you, people who will bear witness without being asked to do so, and will be treacherous and untrustworthy, and they will vow and never fulfill their vows, and fatness will appear among them.\"\nSahih al-Bukhari 3650 -\tBook 62, Hadith 2 -\tVol. 5, Book 57, Hadith 2",

          "question": "What if I wait until the Last Day come and then I can see the resurrection, paradise and hellfire with my own eyes to be sure 100% of what you say. At this time, I think I will believe and be a Muslim. Will being a Muslim save me at this time?",
          "answer": "\nThe true faith is that you believe in \"the unseen\"\nas Allah said. This kind of faith is the required one and the one which makes you enter Paradise and brings you happiness in this life and the Hereafter. But if you believe when you see everything with your eyes on the Last Day, this is not considered \"believing\" because you saw with your eyes. And it will not be accepted from you at this time as Allah stated. When angels come to an unbeliever for death and he sees everything at this time. He sees the angels, paradise and Hellfire, he knows the truth and he implore to be given another chance in life to make good deeds. But it is too late.\nAllah describe this hard moment in these verses:\n\"( 99 ) [For such is the state of the disbelievers], until, when death comes to one of them, he says, \"My Lord, send me back\n( 100 ) That I might do righteousness in that which I left behind.\" No! It is only a word he is saying; and behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected.\"\nAl Mu\"minun – no. 23 – verse 99,100\nTrue believing is that you believe what Allah say to you before you see with your eyes. And you can have proofs for the unseen from what you see with your eyes in this life like Allah's creatures, bounties and provisions for humans and non-humans. And that Allah created everything in this universe with ultimate wisdom.\nExample1: Allah created you in this world and provided for you from all blessings. This is something you can see and feel.\nSo, you should believe Him, when He tell you that he will create you again after death to evaluate your deeds in life.\nWhy do you consider it unbelievable or strange to be created again? He created you the first time from tiny spermatozoa that you cannot see with your naked eye. This spermatozoon was pushed out from your father's urethra to your mother's womb to settle there for nine months and then it was you; A human being living, walking\nand thinking. All this happened with Allah's ultimate power. No doctors or parents are able to control anything from all this. Aren't all these proofs for you to believe Him when He tell you something that will happen and you cannot see it right now? And here you are living and enjoying his blessings and argue about your creator's existence at the same time as it is stated in these great verses:\n\"( 77 ) Does man not consider that We created him from a [mere] sperm-drop - then at once he is a clear adversary?\n( 78 ) And he presents for Us an example and forgets his [own] creation. He says, \"Who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated?\"\n( 79 ) Say, \"He will give them life who produced them the first time; and He is, of all creation, Knowing.\"\nYa Sin – no. 36 – verse 77 – 79\n\"( 64 ) Is He [not best] who begins creation and then repeats it and who provides for you from the heaven and earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"\nAn Naml- no. 27 – verse 64\nExplanation:\nAllah ask and challenge every human: Do you know another God or creator other than Allah who creates from nothing and provides for his creatures? If you know, please tell us and give us your proofs.",

          "question": "But it is hard for me to believe that billions of people on this planet from different nationalities are astray and on the wrong way because they are non-Muslims. And that only Muslims are on the right track and they have the true religion; however, they are fewer in number and in power.",
          "answer": "This has always been the habit throughout history. The followers of the prophets and the faithful adherents to the true religion were few in numbers everywhere throughout history. For example, prophet \"Noah\" only a few people believed him. Likewise, Abraham, Lut, Hud, Saleh and even Moses. All prophets were met by denial, refraining and mockery. Jesus was convicted of lying and using magic and all the repeated convictions. Then finally they conspired to kill him but Allah saved him from their hands. Even prophet\nMuhammad encountered from his people in Makkah very strong refraining and harming. They besieged his tribe for three years to force them to abandon this religion. Even, they tried to kill him. But Allah destined victory for his religion and its followers in the end.\nThis has always been and will always be the habit of people. The adherents of the true religion are few in numbers. They suffer a lot from the majority. They are tortured and convicted of false crimes and names. But in the end, they will be the victorious and the winning people either in this life and the Hereafter or in the Hereafter only. It depends on Allah’s destiny for everyone. It is the law of Allah to test the believers in this life.\nAllah state this law in these verses:\n\"( 2 ) Do the people think that they will be left to say, \"We believe\" and they will not be tried?\n( 3 ) But We have certainly tried those before them, and Allah will surely make evident those who are truthful, and He will surely make evident the liars.\"\nAl 'Ankabut– no. 29 – verse 2,3\nWhen Allah talk about the believers and the righteous people in Qur'an, they are always described as \"few\" in number:\n\"( 40 ) [So it was], until when Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, \"Load upon the ship of each [creature] two mates and your family, except those about whom the word has preceded, and [include] whoever has believed.\" But none had believed with him, except a few.\n( 41 ) And [Noah] said, \"Embark therein; in the name of Allah is its course and its anchorage. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.\"\nHud – no. 11 – verse 40 – 41\n\"( 62 ) [Iblees] said, \"Do You see this one whom You have honored above me? If You delay me until the Day of Resurrection, I will surely destroy his descendants, except for a few.\"\nAl Isra – no. 17 – verse 62\n( 78 ) And it is He who produced for you hearing and vision and hearts; little are you grateful.\nAl Mu\"minun– no. 23 – verse 78\nOn the contrary, when Allah talk about the unbelievers or the people who follow their communities’ or parents' belief blindly and without any authentication or justification, they are always described as \"most\" or \"majority\"\n\"( 116 ) And if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah. They follow not except assumption, and they are not but falsifying.\nAl An'am– no.6 – verse 116\n\"( 44 ) Or do you think that most of them hear or reason? They are not except like livestock. Rather, they are [even] more astray in [their] way.\"\nAl Furqan– no. 25 – verse 44\n\"( 73 ) And indeed, your Lord is full of bounty for the people, but\nmost of them do not show gratitude.\"\nAn Naml– no.27 – verse 73\n\"( 4 ) As a giver of good tidings and a warner; but most of them turn away, so they do not hear.\"\nFussilat – no. 41 – verse 4\n\"( 38 ) And We did not create the heavens and earth and that between them in play.\n( 39 ) We did not create them except in truth, but most of them do not know.\"\nAd Dukhan– no. 44 – verse 38 – 39\nSo, try to be from the few winners and do not be misguided by the many blind losers.",

          "answer": "If a man lived and died as an unbeliever, whatever good deeds he made in this life, they will never benefit him in the Last Day. Allah created man primarily to worship and obey his creator. So, this is the main and basic target we were created for. If we do not carry out and maintain the main target, all other great and magnificent deeds or inventions or whatsoever will never benefit us in front of our creator.\nAllah said this in Qur'an:\n( 21 ) And those who do not expect the meeting with Us say, \"Why were not angels sent down to us, or [why] do we [not] see our Lord?\" They have certainly become arrogant within themselves and [become] insolent with great insolence.\n( 22 ) The day they see the angels - no good tidings will there be that day for the criminals, and [the angels] will say, \"Prevented and inaccessible.\"\n( 23 ) And We will regard what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed.\nAl Furqan – no. 25 – verse 21 – 23\nExplanation:\nAllah describe in these verses the arrogant unbelievers in this life who said we will believe only if we see Allah or if He send angels down to us. He say that all their deeds in this life will be as dispersed dust or nothing.\nProphet Muhammad exaggerated this fact in this Hadeeth.\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as stating that Allah the Most High and Exalted said:\nI am the One, One Who does not stand in need of a partner. If anyone does anything in which he associates anyone else with Me, I shall abandon him with one whom he associates with Allah.\nSahih Muslim - 2985 - In-book reference - Book 55, Hadith 58\nExplanation: Allah accept and reward deeds that were done for his sake only. Any deed which was done with intentions other than satisfying the creator, will be discarded whatever this deed was great or beneficial according to humans.",

          "answer": "It is very dangerous to do this because Allah is different from anything you can imagine. He is the creator of everything. In brief, Allah is beyond our minds. Every Muslim should refrain from imagining a specific shape for Allah because this is considered as a kind of disbelief in the qualities of Allah if it is done repeatedly and intentionally.\nIf a Muslim's imagination tempts him to imagine Allah in any concrete shape, he should do three things:\n1.\tRemember this great verse in Qur'an:\n\"There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.\"\nAsh-Shura– no.42 – verse 11\n2.\tRemember that the Divine self of Allah is beyond human minds. And if you want to know how Allah is great, you should think about his creation and look at his huge universe but never think about his Divine self.\n3.\tAsk Allah for forgiveness and supplicate to Allah to help you get rid of these imaginations.",

And in each case, Allah want to see how people will do with what they were given. Will they be obedient, thankful and patient or will they be disobedient, insurgent, impatient and corrupt? Surely, Allah know what they will do, but He want to give them the chance and the time to see their deeds with their own eyes and establish the proof so that they do not complain on the Last Day that they were not given the chance to perform good deeds.\nThis logic is clear in the following verse:\n\"( 35 ) Every soul will taste death.

Indeed, Allah is swift in account.\nIbrahim – no. 14 – Verse 48 - 51\nNote that Allah mingles the incidents of both of them as one day in these verses.\n( 1 ) When the sun is wrapped up [in darkness] ( 2 ) And when the stars fall, dispersing,\n( 3 ) And when the mountains are removed\n( 4 ) And when full-term she-camels are neglected ( 5 ) And when the wild beasts are gathered\n( 6 ) And when the seas are filled with flame ( 7 ) And when the souls are paired\n( 8 ) And when the girl [who was] buried alive is asked ( 9 ) For what sin she was killed\n( 10 ) And when the pages are made public ( 11 ) And when the sky is stripped away\n( 12 ) And when Hellfire is set ablaze\n( 13 ) And when Paradise is brought near,\n( 14 ) A soul will [then] know what it has brought [with it].\nAt-Takwir – No. 81 – verses 1 - 14\nAllah depict some incidents of the Resurrection Day only in these verses:\n( 41 ) And listen on the Day when the Caller will call out from a place that is near -\n( 42 ) The Day they will hear the blast [of the Horn] in truth. That is the Day of Emergence [from the graves].\n( 43 ) Indeed, it is We who give life and cause death, and to Us is the destination\n( 44 ) On the Day the earth breaks away from them [and they emerge] rapidly; that is a gathering easy for Us.\nQaf – No. 50 – verses 41 – 44\nAllah summarize the two days together in these verses:\n( 68 ) And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on.\n( 69 ) And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, and the record [of deeds] will be placed, and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought, and it will be judged between them in truth, and they will not be wronged.\n( 70 ) And every soul will be fully compensated [for] what it did; and He is most knowing of what they do.\nAz Zumar – No. 39 – verses 68 – 70",

We are discussing about the Last Hour.\nThereupon he said: It will not come until you see ten signs before and (in this connection) he made a mention of the smoke, Dajjal, the beast, the rising of the sun from the west, the descent of Jesus son of Mary (Allah be pleased with him), the Gog and Magog, and land-slides in three places, one in the east, one in the west and one in Arabia at the end of which fire would burn forth from the Yemen, and would drive people to the place of their assembly.\nSahih Muslim 2901 a - In-book reference : Book 54, Hadith 51\nIt was narrated from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:\n\"Hasten to do good deeds (before) six things (happen): The rising of the sun from the west (place of its setting), the smoke, the beast of the earth, Dajjal (False Christ), that which will happen to each of you (death); and that which will happen to all people (the Day of Resurrection).\"\nSunan Ibn Majah 4056 - In-book reference - Book 36, Hadith 131\nExplanation: people may ask many questions about how and when and where these signs will start. But, in fact, this is part of the unseen that we should believe in without many questions.\nYou can understand more details if you refer to the explanation of these hadeeths in Sunnah books.",

          "question": "And what are the dead people doing in their graves until the Last Day and the Resurrection Day? Do they feel the time passing? Do they have any kind of consciousness or any level of life?",
          "answer": "The dead people have a level of life which is known only by Allah. It is like a spiritual life without a body. It is similar to what happens when you see a dream while sleeping. They do not feel the time passing. It is similar to someone who sleeps deeply for nine or ten hours and loses the time consciousness and then he wakes up suddenly. He thinks that he slept for only one hour or less because he lost the time awareness while sleeping. The same happens with the dead people. And Allah know the details best of course.\nMany Haddeths describe this kind of life in graves. These are some of them:\nAbu Hurairah narrated that:\nThe Messenger of Allah said: \"When the deceased - or he said when one of you - is buried, two angels, black and blue (eyed_ come to him. One of them is called Al-Munkar, and the other An-Nakir. They say: 'What did you used to say about this man?' So he says what he was saying (before death) 'He is Allah's slave and His Messenger. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.' So they say: 'We knew that you would say this.' Then his grave is expanded to seventy by seventy cubits, then it is illuminated for him. Then it is said to him: 'Sleep.' So he said: 'Can I return to my family to inform them?' They say: 'Sleep as a newlywed, whom none awakens but the dearest of his family.' Until Allah resurrects him from his resting place. \"If he was a hypocrite he would say: 'I heard people saying something, so I said the same; I do not know.' So they said: 'We knew you would say that.' So the earth is told: 'Constrict him.' So it constricts around him, squeezing his ribs together. He continues being punished like that until Allah resurrects him from his resting place.\"\nJami` at-Tirmidhi 1071 - In-book reference : Book 10, Hadith 107\nAbu Sa'id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:\nMessenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"When a dead body is placed on a bier and men carry it on their shoulders, if the deceased was pious, it (the corpse) will say: 'Take me in haste'; but if he was not, it will say (to its bearers): 'Woe to it. Where are you taking it?' Everything except man hears its voice. Had a human being heard its voice, he would have surely died\".\nAl- Bukhari - Arabic/English book reference: Book 1, Hadith 444 Riyad as-Salihin 444 : Reference\nThese are some news from the prophet about what happens to the dead, but the details and the realities of what happen remain as a part of the unseen that we should believe in. For example, you may say, how the corpse will speak? My brief answer is: Allah is all- powerful and omnipotent. It is easy for Him to make anything speak.",

No one knows how the resurrection will happen as no one knows how the creation of man and the universe was made.

I said: Allah's Messenger, will the male and the female be together on the Day and would they be looking at one another?

          "question": "How long will the Resurrection and Judgement Day last? What are the main stages of this Day in brief?",
          "answer": "Allah answered the duration of the Resurrection and Judgement Day in the Qur’an:\n\n\"A supplicant asked for a punishment bound to happen. To the disbelievers; of it there is no preventer. [It is] from Allah, owner of the ways of ascent. The angels and the Spirit will ascend to Him during a Day the extent of which is fifty thousand years.\"\nAl-Ma‘arij – no. 70 – verses 1–4\n\nThe stages of this Day can be summarized as follows, starting from death in this worldly life until eternal residence in Paradise or Hellfire:\n\n1. **Spiritual life in the grave (Barzakh):** Humans will experience a form of spiritual life similar to the state of sleeping and dreaming. Each person’s experience will depend on his deeds in worldly life. The full details of this stage belong to the unseen, but the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) gave indications of it in authentic hadiths.\n\n2. **The first blowing of the trumpet:** All living beings in the heavens and the earth will die, and life will completely cease.\n\n\"And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on.\"\nAz-Zumar – no. 39 – verse 68\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said:\n\"How can I be comfortable when the one with the Horn has placed it to his mouth, listening for when he will be commanded to blow it?\"\n(Jamiʿ at-Tirmidhi 2431 – Hasan)\n\n3. **The period between the two trumpets:** Its duration is unknown. Allah will send a special rain from the sky, from which all human bodies—from Adam until the last human—will grow again without souls.\n\n4. **The second blowing of the trumpet and Resurrection:** Souls will return to their bodies, graves will open, and all humans will rise and be driven by angels toward the land of the Final Gathering.\n\n5. **Gathering and waiting for a long time**\n6. **Receiving the record of deeds**\n7. **Reckoning (Hisab)**\n8. **The Scale (Mizan)**\n9. **The Pool of Al-Kawthar**\n10. **Crossing the Sirat**\n11. **Intercession (Shafa‘ah)**\n12. **Eternal residence in Paradise or Hellfire**\n\nFurther details of these stages are mentioned throughout the Qur’an and the authentic Sunnah, and are also illustrated in diagram no. 9 (p. 278) at the end of this book.",

          "answer": "Paradise (Jannah) is the eternal home prepared by Allah for the believers who had faith and performed righteous deeds. The Qur’an and the authentic Sunnah provide clear descriptions that give a sufficient illustration of its nature and blessings.\n\nAllah says:\n\n\"Is the description of Paradise, which the righteous are promised, wherein are rivers of water unaltered, rivers of milk the taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of purified honey, in which they will have from all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their Lord, like those who abide eternally in the Fire and are given scalding water that will sever their intestines?\"\nMuhammad – no. 47 – verse 15\n\n\"The example of Paradise, which the righteous have been promised, is that beneath it rivers flow. Its fruit is everlasting and its shade. That is the consequence for the righteous, and the consequence for the disbelievers is the Fire.\"\nAr-Ra‘d – no. 13 – verse 35\n\n\"Whoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except by its like, but whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer – those will enter Paradise, being provided for therein without account.\"\nGhafir – no. 40 – verse 40\n\n\"And those who have believed and done righteous deeds – We will surely assign to them lofty chambers in Paradise beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. Excellent is the reward of the righteous workers.\"\nAl-‘Ankabut – no. 29 – verse 58\n\n\"Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds – they will have the Gardens of Paradise as a lodging, wherein they will abide forever. They will not desire any transfer from it.\"\nAl-Kahf – no. 18 – verses 107–108\n\nAllah further describes the life of Paradise:\n\n\"On adorned thrones, reclining on them, facing one another. There will circulate among them youthful servants, with vessels, pitchers, and a cup from a flowing spring – no headache will they have therefrom, nor will they be intoxicated – and fruits of what they choose, and the meat of fowl from whatever they desire. And for them are companions with large, beautiful eyes, like well-protected pearls, as a reward for what they used to do. They will not hear therein ill speech or sin – only the saying: ‘Peace, peace.’\"\nAl-Waqi‘ah – no. 56 – verses 15–26\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) narrated that Allah said:\n\n\"I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, and no human heart has ever imagined, apart from what Allah has already informed you of.\"\nSahih Muslim 2824\n\nIn conclusion, Paradise is beyond full human comprehension. Its pleasures are eternal, its blessings never end, and its life is free from pain, sorrow, and death. A believer can learn more about Paradise by reflecting upon the Qur’an and the authentic Sunnah.",

          "question": "What is Hellfire? What is it like? Where is it? And how will life be there?",
          "answer": "Hellfire (Jahannam) is the eternal abode prepared by Allah for those who disbelieved in Him, rejected His signs, and persisted in injustice and corruption. The Qur’an provides clear and vivid descriptions of Hellfire, its nature, and the condition of its inhabitants.\n\nAllah says:\n\n\"And say: ‘The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills – let him believe; and whoever wills – let him disbelieve.’ Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which scalds their faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place.\"\nAl-Kahf – no. 18 – verse 29\n\nAllah also says:\n\n\"And for those who disbelieved in their Lord is the punishment of Hell, and wretched is the destination. When they are thrown into it, they hear from it a dreadful inhaling while it boils up. It almost bursts with rage. Every time a company is thrown into it, its keepers ask them, ‘Did there not come to you a warner?’ They will say, ‘Yes, a warner had come to us, but we denied and said: Allah has not sent down anything; you are not but in great error.’ And they will say, ‘If only we had listened or reasoned, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze.’\"\nAl-Mulk – no. 67 – verses 6–10\n\nAllah further says:\n\n\"Say: ‘Worship whatever you will besides Him.’ Say: ‘Indeed, the losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, that is the clear loss.’ They will have canopies of Fire above them and canopies beneath them. By that Allah warns His servants. O My servants, then fear Me.\"\nAz-Zumar – no. 39 – verses 15–16\n\nAnd Allah describes the companions of Hellfire:\n\n\"And the companions of the left – what are the companions of the left? They will be in scorching fire and scalding water, and a shade of black smoke, neither cool nor beneficial. Indeed, they were before that indulging in luxury, and they persisted in great sin. And they used to say: ‘When we die and become dust and bones, are we indeed to be resurrected, and our forefathers as well?’\"\nAl-Waqi‘ah – no. 56 – verses 41–48\n\nIn summary, Hellfire is a place of severe punishment, regret, and eternal loss for those who rejected faith after the truth was made clear to them. Its torment is continuous, its suffering is intense, and its inhabitants will live a life of humiliation and despair. Many additional descriptions of Hellfire are found throughout the Qur’an and in the authentic Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).",

For them therein is [violent] exhaling and inhaling.\n( 107 ) [They will be] abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except what your Lord should will. Indeed, your Lord is an effecter of what He intends.\n( 108 ) And as for those who were [destined to be] prosperous, they will be in Paradise, abiding therein as long as the heavens and\nthe earth endure, except what your Lord should will - a bestowal uninterrupted.\"\nHud – no. 11 – verse 106 – 108\n\"( 6 ) Indeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein.

And even if they were returned, they would return to that which they were forbidden; and indeed, they are liars.\"\nAl An'am– no. 6 – verse 27 – 28\nAllah state clearly in these verses that if He returned the disbelievers to life again, they would do the same deeds.

          "answer": "Hopefully, many people who are in hellfire will be saved after specific times and will be sent to paradise. The length of their stay in hellfire will depend on their deeds and the amount of true belief in their hearts. Only Allah know the secrets of these matters of course. However, the only people who will stay therein eternally are the unbelievers.\nThese verses confirm the eternal stay of the disbelievers in hellfire:\n( 64 ) Indeed, Allah has cursed the disbelievers and prepared for them a Blaze.\n( 65 ) Abiding therein forever, they will not find a protector or a helper.\n( 66 ) The Day their faces will be turned about in the Fire, they will say, \"How we wish we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger.\"\nAl Ahzab – No.33 – verses 64 - 66\nThis long hadeeth sheds light on how many groups of people will be saved from Hell.\n\"\tBy One in Whose hand is my life, there will be none among\nyou more eager to claim a right than the believers on the Day of Resurrection for (saying their) brethren in the Fire who would say: O our Lord, they were fasting along with us, and praying and performing pilgrimage. It will be said to them: Take out those whom you recognize. Then their persons would be forbidden to the Fire; and they would take out a large number of people who had been overtaken by Fire up to the middle of the shank or up to the knees. They would then say: O our Lord I not one of those about whom Thou didst give us command remains in it. He will then say: Go back and bring out those in whose hearts you find good of the weight of a dinar Then they will take out a large number of people. Then they would say: O our Lord! we have not left anyone about whom You commanded us. He will then say: Go back and bring out those in whose hearts you find as much as half a dinar of good. Then they will take out a large number of people, and would say: O our Lord!\nnot one of those about whom Thou commanded us we have left in it. Then He would say: Go back and in whose heart, you find good to the weight of a particle bring him out. They would bring out a large number of people, and would then say: O our Lord, now we have not left anyone in it (Hell) having any good in him.\nSahih Muslim, Book 1, Hadith 361\nSection F – Main Topics: Questions about the righteous way.

          "question": "So how should a Muslim deal with adherents of other religions in general? What is Islam's stance about this?",
          "answer": "A Muslim should deal with people of other religions in a nice, kind and fair way as long as they do not harm Muslims or kill them or fight with them.\nAnd even if there was aggression from their side on Muslims, Muslims should not behave on an individual basis or take personal decisions of counter attack. This decision must be taken by the leaders like the president or the king or whoever is in power if it was relevant to a group of people or a whole society.\nHarming or killing someone from a different religion is a major and dangerous sin in Islam.\nThe following verses give a clear idea about this concept:\n( 8 ) Allah do not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them.\nIndeed, Allah loves those who act justly.\n( 9 ) Allah only forbid you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion - [forbids] that you make allies of them. And whoever makes allies of them, then it is those who are the wrongdoers.\nAl Mumtahanah – no. 60 – verse 8, 9\nSafwan reported from a number of Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the authority of their fathers who were relatives of each other.\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Beware, if anyone wrongs a contracting man, or diminishes his right, or forces him to work beyond his capacity, or takes from him anything without his consent, I shall plead for him on the Day of Judgment.\nSunan Abi Dawud 3052 - Book 20, Hadith 125\nNarrated `Abdullah bin `Amr:\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Whoever killed a Mu'ahid (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling).\nSahih al-Bukhari 6914 - Book 87, Hadith 52\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Whoever kills a Mu'ahid who has the protection of Allah and the protection of his Messenger, will not smell the fragrance of Paradise, even though its fragrance may be detected from a distance of Seventy years.”\nSunan Ibn Majah - Book 21, Hadith 2789\nMu’ahad: means someone from other religions who live peacefully among Muslims.",

          "question": "Tell me more about \"the devils\" or \"Satan\"? Are there really devils that we cannot, see? What is Islam's stance about these creatures?",
          "answer": "Devils are there. Devils are a section of \" the Jinn\", but devils are unbeliever Jinn. Those creatures are unseen by man. However, they can see us. They are everywhere. Allah created them for many reasons. One of them is to be \"fitna\" or \"test\" for humans. There is a long history of hatred and animosity between man and the devil.\nThere are various Qur'anic verses that tell us about this story.\nI will cite for you a few of them and you can find the rest in Qur'an:\nThis was the first encounter between humans and \"devils\" when \"Iblees\" refused to prostrate to Adam:\n( 34 ) And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate before Adam\"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.\nAl Baqarah– no.2 – verse 34\nThen, this important conversation happened between Allah and \"Iblees\" the leader or the father of \"devils\". In the end, Allah agreed to let him live until all the human race die so that he can mislead them. \"Iblees swore by Allah to mislead all human beings except those sincere servants of Allah:\n( 75 ) [Allah] said, \"O Iblees, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands? Were you arrogant [then], or were you [already] among the haughty?\"\n( 76 ) He said, \"I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay.\"\n( 77 ) [Allah] said, \"Then get out of Paradise, for indeed, you are expelled.\n( 78 ) And indeed, upon you is My curse until the Day of Recompense.\"\n( 79 ) He said, \"My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected.\"\n( 80 ) [Allah] said, \"So indeed, you are of those reprieved ( 81 ) Until the Day of the time well-known.\"\n( 82 ) [Iblees] said, \"By your might, I will surely mislead them all ( 83 ) Except, among them, Your chosen servants.\"\nSad- no. 38 – verse 75 – 83\nIn this verse, Allah warn us not to follow the temptation of \"Satan\" or \"Iblees\" or the \"devil\" because if we follow his temptation, we will definitely be losers:\n( 27 ) O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from Paradise, stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts.\nAl A'raf– no. 7 – verse 27\nIn this verse, Allah explain for us that \"Satan\" and his children can see us whereas, we cannot:\nIndeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them. Indeed, we have made the devils allies to those who do not believe.\nAl A'raf– no. 7 – verse 27\nIn this verse – as in many others – Allah explain for us that \"Satan' or \"the devil\" is a clear enemy for us and we should never worship him or obey him. We should always worship and obey Allah, our creator:\n( 60 ) Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy -\n( 61 ) And that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path.\nYa Sin– no.36 – verse 60 – 61",

          "question": "What about angels? What does Islam say about them? Are they really there?",
          "answer": "Yes, angels are there. They are also unseen by humans. These are creatures made from light. Allah created them for doing so many different jobs. They never disobey Allah. They are always obedient. Some of them are high-rank angels like \"Jabraiel\" who used to bring Allah's revelation from the heavens down to Allah's messengers on earth. Another example is “the Death Angel”. This is the angel who is responsible for taking souls of humans when their life come to an end. Another example is \"Rakeeb\" and \"Ateed\". Those are two angels who accompany every human being throughout his life to register his good deeds and bad ones. There are so many others with different jobs. You can read about them in detail in Qur'an:\nHere are some verses that talk about angels:\n( 6 ) O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, over which are [appointed] angels, harsh and severe; they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded.\nAt Tahrim – no. 66 – verse 6\n( 13 ) And the thunder exalts [Allah] with praise of Him - and the angels [as well] from fear of Him - and He sends thunderbolts and strikes therewith whom He wills while they dispute about Allah; and He is severe in assault.\nAr Ra'd– no.13 – verse 13\n( 19 ) And they have made the angels, who are servants of the Most Merciful, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded, and they will be questioned.\nAz Zukhruf– no.43 – verse 19\n( 172 ) Never would the Messiah disdain to be a servant of Allah, nor would the angels near [to Him]. And whoever disdains His worship and is arrogant - He will gather them to Himself all together.\nAn Nisa – no.4 – verse 172",

          "question": "Most people in this life compete and contend for accumulating wealth, fame, power and all life pleasures. But when we die, no one takes his property, money, children or authority What should I compete for? What will stay with me in my grave and in the eternal life?",
          "answer": "Definitely right. Whatever one is rich and powerful, he enters his grave poor and helpless. Only your deeds accompany you in the grave. So, the right and wise competition should be in good deeds to win paradise not in world pleasures and possessions. Good deeds stay with you in the eternal life whereas world pleasures are temporary and deceiving.\nNotice the following verses which urge you to compete for the everlasting pleasures of paradise with good deeds in this life:\n\"( 18 ) No! Indeed, the record of the righteous is in 'illiyyun. ( 19 ) And what can make you know what is 'illiyyun?\n( 20 ) It is [their destination recorded in] a register inscribed ( 21 ) Which is witnessed by those brought near [to Allah]. ( 22 ) Indeed, the righteous will be in pleasure\n( 23 ) On adorned couches, observing.\n( 24 ) You will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure. ( 25 ) They will be given to drink [pure] wine [which was] sealed.\n( 26 ) The last of it is musk. So for this let the competitors compete.\" Al Mutaffifin– no. 83 – verse 18 – 26",

          "question": "But the fact is that most people in the world are controlled by their lusts and world pleasures like love of money, women, power…etc. How should a Muslim deal with such world pleasures and lusts?",
          "answer": "These lusts and world pleasures were created by Allah intentionally to test people. If people spend their lives busy collecting money or enjoying other pleasures like children, women, businesses or power, they will be losers on the Last Day.\nAllah warned us in many verses not to be busy with these pleasures and forget worshipping Allah or show little attention to Allah's orders.\nDefinitely it is permissible to have and enjoy these pleasures but with reasonable amounts which render you able to perform the main job you were created for. That is, worshipping Allah.\nHere are some verses that present these facts:\n( 14 ) Beautified for people is the love of that which they desire - of women and sons, heaped-up sums of gold and silver, fine branded horses, and cattle and tilled land. That is the enjoyment of worldly life, but Allah has with Him the best return.\n( 15 ) Say, \"Shall I inform you of [something] better than that? For those who fear Allah will be gardens in the presence of their Lord beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and purified spouses and approval from Allah. And Allah is Seeing of [His] servants -\nAl 'Imran– no.3 – verse 14,15\n( 9 ) O you who have believed, let not your wealth and your children divert you from remembrance of Allah. And whoever does that - then those are the losers.\n( 10 ) And spend [in the way of Allah] from what We have provided you before death approaches one of you and he says, \"My Lord, if only You would delay me for a brief term so I would give charity and be among the righteous.\"\n( 11 ) But never will Allah delay a soul when its time has come. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do.\nAl Munafiqun– no.63 – verse 9 – 11\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSection G – Wrap-up of the previous sections and Questions about how to be a Muslim, how to prepare for this decisive change, how to face potential challenges, how to prepare for post-Islam life and final essential pieces of advice.",

I am not specialized in Jurisprudence. I am a normal Muslim. Moreover, I am a human. Humans make mistakes even if they are experts in what they are talking about. I may have missed some important Qur'anic verses or some important Hadeeths during my answers. Qur'an and Sunnah are a deep ocean of knowledge. So, you have to read the Qur'an and the Sunnah yourself if you want more details and authentication about what I have told you. I have only tried to give you the basics.",

          "question": "What if I tell you that I am not convinced of all or most of what you said? And I will never convert to Islam?",
          "answer": "It is all up to your discretion definitely. It is your free choice to believe or not to believe. I am only trying to explain the facts of Islam to you. Allah, the creator Himself gave humans the free choice to believe or not, but they will bear the consequences of their choice. They will be accountable.\nThe following verses illustrate these ideas:\n\"( 256 ) There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.\"\nAl Baqarah– no.2 – verse 256\n\"( 6 ) For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.\"\nAl Kafirun– no. 109 – verse 6\n\"( 6 ) And whoever strives only strives for [the benefit of] himself. Indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds.\"\nAl 'Ankabut– no. 29 – verse 6\n\"( 44 ) Whoever disbelieves - upon him is [the consequence of] his disbelief. And whoever does righteousness - they are for themselves preparing,\" Ar Rum– no. 30 – verse 44\nAlso, note that if you believe in Allah and his messenger and obey them in everything and spend all your life praying, this will not benefit Allah in anyway. Also, all your prayers and obedience will never add an atom to Allah's universe. Likewise, it will not benefit me in anyway either. The benefits will be for yourself only because Allah will grant you a happy life, much happier than the one you live right now. And you will feel the sweetness of believing in your heart. By believing, you will feel that your life has a target and has a meaning. You will recognize that life on Earth is only a short life for testing people and it is-definitely- followed by death and by another eternal life in the Hereafter. So, you will understand the true meaning of death. Also, you will not be sad or angry for anything you lose in this life because you will know that whatever happens to you is destined by Allah. Most important of all is that you will survive hellfire on the day of resurrection, and you will enjoy Paradise eternally in unimaginable blessings and happiness.\nOn the contrary, if you refuse Allah's true religion, you will be the only loser; as, you will lose real happiness in this life and eternal happy life in Paradise in the Hereafter. You will only live this life concerned about collecting money, eating, drinking and enjoying and then finally waiting for death and hellfire. This situation is, actually, very hateful, miserable and shameful.\nAllah elucidate these facts in Qur’an conspicuously:\n\"( 7 ) If you disbelieve - indeed, Allah is Free from need of you. And He does not approve for His servants disbelief. And if you are grateful, He approves it for you; and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you about what you used to do. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.\"\nAz Zumar– no. 39 – verse 7\nAllah describe the stark paradox between believers and unbelievers in the following verses:\n\"( 12 ) Indeed, Allah will admit those who have believed and done righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow, but those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as grazing livestock eat, and the Fire will be a residence for them.\"\nMuhammad – no. 47 – verse 12",

Then compare the answers carefully. Such comparison will reveal clear differences and highlight many important points.\n\n2- If you are skeptical about some of what has been mentioned, raise your hands sincerely to the Creator and supplicate truthfully. You may say: \"O You who created the heavens, the earth, humankind, and everything in existence, if Islam is the true religion, then guide me to it.\" Repeat this supplication sincerely, and Allah will guide you to the truth in one way or another.\n\n3- Attempt to answer some of the challenging questions posed by Allah in the Qur’an. A list of these questions is provided at the end of this book. If you are able to answer them satisfactorily without embracing Islam, then the choice remains yours. (See page 251 for the full list.)\n\n4- Randomly select some of the Qur’anic verses and Prophetic Hadeeths cited in this book and verify their authenticity using trusted and well-known sources of the Qur’an and Sunnah.\n\n5- Confirm the accuracy of some of the historical events mentioned in this book by consulting well-established and reputable historical references and books.",

          "answer": "My advice is, simply, that you should know that the essence of Islam is that you submit and surrender thoroughly to Allah's will and his messenger's instructions because whatever the knowledge you may possess, you will never be able to discern the wisdom and the real reasons behind everything Allah destined in this life. Your limited mind and senses will never be able to understand how and why everything happens in this world.\nAnd if you insist on using your limited mind to understand everything and the wisdom behind it, your mind will fail you and you will find many incidents in this world meaningless. Your disability to understand why everything happens in this or that way may lead you to be an atheist as it led many millions of people before you.\nMan is very limited in means of strength, knowledge and understanding. In the first pages of this book, you knew that you have no idea about your own soul which gives life to your body. Even, you have no idea how it leaves your body every day when you sleep and then comes back to your body without any control from your side. All the modern sciences with its technology and labs do not know anything or have any control on the soul either. The soul is just a simple example.\nAnd if you look around you, you will find hundreds but thousands of examples for Allah's powers and creation. At the same time, you will find hundreds but thousands of examples for man's weakness, ignorance and inability to control his own body or the world around him. So, do not let your mind fool you and do not let the little knowledge that you have mislead you. Submit to Allah completely and say what Allah taught us to say in this verse:\n\" And they say, \"We hear and we obey. [We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination.\"\nAl Baqarah– no. 2 – verse 285",

Use it to know and recognize your creator's greatness and understand His book to you. But do not use it to understand things which are beyond your mind's limits like destiny, and why this happens and why this doesn't happen. And why Allah made this in such a specific way, etc.…….\nIf you can understand some of the wisdom behind Allah's actions, it is okay and good. If you can't – and this will happen frequently – say: \"I believe in Allah and trust Him.\" By this way only you can live happily and peacefully in the middle of this tumultuous life and win eternal paradise in the Hereafter.",

          "question": "How do you see the future of Islam? Do you think its followers will increase or decrease? Do you think it will be the overwhelming religion in the world?",
          "answer": "Islam is the true religion of Allah. And the true religion of Allah must win and be the overwhelming one. It will not necessarily have the greatest number of followers. But it will surely be the powerful and the winner one day. This is Allah's promise in Qur'an. But this will happen when Muslims abide by Qur'an regulations and follow their messenger. Muslims became powerful and winners when they followed the instructions of Qur’an and Sunnah. And this will not happen again unless they follow Qur’an and Sunnah again. Allah’s rules never change.\nThe following verses confirm that Allah’s religion must be the winner and the most powerful one day against the will of the unbelievers:\n\"( 32 ) They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it.\"\nAt Tawbah– no.9 – verse 32\n( 9 ) It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, although those who associate others with Allah dislike it.\nAl-Sa'af – no. 61 – verse 9",

          "question": "Do you think I will find the happiness I have been looking for if I convert to Islam?",
          "answer": "I am sure100 % that Islam will give you the happiness which can never be bought by millions of dollars. It will grant you the happiness which is not to be found in travelling to different countries, driving luxurious cars, living in affluent villas or enjoying pleasures on fascinating beaches.\nIf you believe in Allah and follow his messenger in all his instructions, you will find a happiness that is only recognized by people who experienced it. It is the happiness of self-satisfaction and trust in your creator.\tI am sorry. I think it\ncannot be expressed by language. Lucky people can experience it, but it is very hard to explain it.\nIs it not enough that you will not be scared from anything that happen to you in this world? Is it not enough that you will never be afraid of death? You will believe that death is the way to meet your creator and live in Paradise eternally in an unimaginable and eternal happiness.\nRealistically speaking, I can see you have tried everything to get happiness and have travelled everywhere and have made everything expensive to get it. It is also obvious that you haven't found it yet.\nSo, why don't you try this way also? You will lose nothing. It is not an expensive one. I will not charge you any fees for my advice and you will not pay any money to be a Muslim. Just try it as you have tried every other way. I assure you, if you do this with a pure heart and true search of the right way, you will never regret it.",

          "question": "But I made so many bad sins during my life. Will Allah forgive me if I convert to Islam?",
          "answer": "Allah forgive all sins whatever they were provided that you believe in Him as the one and only creator and believe in his messengers and his angels and his books and the Last Day and your fate whether good or bad.\nThe following verses and Hadeeth are evidence:\n( 53 ) Say, \"O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\"\n( 54 ) And return [in repentance] to your Lord and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you; then you will not be helped.\nAz Zumar – no.39 – verse 53 – 54\n( 116 ) Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly gone far astray.\nAn Nisa\" – no.4 – verse 116\nIbn Shumasah reported:\nWe visited 'Amr bin Al-'as (May Allah be pleased with him) when he was in his deathbed\tThen he ('Amr) turned his\nface towards us and said:\n“\tWhen Allah instilled the love for Islam in my heart, I\nwent to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said, 'Extend your right hand, so that I pledge allegiance to you.' He (ﷺ) stretched out his right hand, but I withdrew my hand. He said, 'What is the matter, 'Amr?' I said, 'I wish to lay down some conditions.' He asked, 'What conditions do you wish to put forward?' I replied, 'To be granted forgiveness.' He said, 'Do you not know that (embracing) Islam wipes out all that has gone before it (previous misdeeds). Verily, emigration wipes out all the previous sins, and the Hajj (pilgrimage) wipes out all the previous sins.'\nRiyad as-Salihin 710\nIn-book reference\t: Book 1, Hadith 31",

Struggles started as Man started living on Earth and will continue to the Last Day of this world.\nComprehensive peace and thorough happiness are impossible in this life. So, whether you are a believer or an unbeliever, you will face struggles and disputes. But, when you are a believer, you will be rewarded for patience and wise reactions. However, no rewards are offered to unbelievers.\nThe following verses show the inevitability of struggles on Earth among individuals and nations. They also show some of the wisdom behind these struggles and conflicts:\n“\tAnd We said, \"Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one\nanother, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time.\"\nAl-Baqara – no. 2– verse 36\n( 251 ) So they defeated them by permission of Allah, and David killed Goliath, and Allah gave him the kingship and prophethood and taught him from that which He willed.

          "question": "And If problems, sickness, poverty and calamities overwhelm me while I am a Muslim, does it mean that Allah do not like me or I am not a good Muslim? What does it mean in Islam if a Muslim is involved in sickness, poverty and calamities?",
          "answer": "We were primarily created in this life to be tested as you learnt before. So, it is not logical or reasonable that anyone in this life will lead a happy and peaceful life until his death.\nCalamities and problems are a must. Or how the test would be performed. Some people think that the more misfortunes they have in this life, the less loved and preferred they are by their creator. And the more happiness and fortunes they have, the more loved and preferred they are.\nActually, this is totally wrong. The fact is completely different. Allah usually test the true Muslims with more calamities and misfortunes either to test their true belief or to raise them in degrees.\nMany verses in Quran shed light on this fact:\n( 155 ) And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient,\n( 156 ) Who, when disaster strikes them, say, \"Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.\"\n( 157 ) Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the [rightly] guided.\nAl Baqarah – no. 2 – verse 155 – 157\n(23) Chapter: Patience at the time of calamity\nIt was narrated from Mus’ab bin Sa’d that his father, Sa’d bin Abu\nWaqqas, said:\n“I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, which people are most severely tested?’ He said: ‘The Prophets, then the next best and the next best. A person is tested according to his religious commitment. If he is steadfast in his religious commitment, he will be tested more severely,\nand if he is frail in his religious commitment, his test will be according to his commitment. Trials will continue to afflict a person until they leave him walking on the earth with no sin on him.’”\nReference: Sunan Ibn Majah 4023 :\t Book 36, Hadith 98 :\tIn-book reference\nEnglish translation\t: Vol. 5, Book 36, Hadith 4023",

          "question": "And if I have a lot of money and fortunes while I am a Muslim, what should I do with this wealth according to Islam?",
          "answer": "Firstly, you are free to do in your wealth what you like provided that you do not do an impermissible act. Do the right and get away from the forbidden and do not spend too much. This is stated in Qur'an:\n( 31 ) O children of Adam, take your adornment at every masjid, and eat and drink, but be not excessive. Indeed, He likes not those who commit excess.\nAl A'raf – no.7 – verse 31\nIn the coming verse, Allah instruct us to be moderate in spending. Not too much and not too little.\n( 29 ) And do not make your hand [as] chained to your neck or extend it completely and [thereby] become blamed and insolvent. ( 30 ) Indeed, your Lord extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. Indeed He is ever, concerning His servants, Acquainted and Seeing.\nAl Isra\" – no. 17 – verse 29 – 30\nIn this verse, Allah compare those who spend wastefully to the devils.\n( 26 ) And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully.\n( 27 ) Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils, and ever has Satan been to his Lord ungrateful.\nAl Isra\" – no.17 – verse 26 – 27\nBut take care:\nOne of the pillars of Islam is to pay a small amount of your money to the poor if your wealth reaches a specific amount. (Refer to Islamic Legislation to know more details). This is called \"Zakat\" or \"paying alms to the poor”. This is a must for any Muslim to do. Many verses in Qur'an talk about this pillar. And it is always paired with prayer to show its importance:\n( 110 ) And establish prayer and give zakah, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. Indeed, Allah of what you do, is Seeing.\nAl Baqarah – no. 2 – verse 110\nAnd after paying \"Zakah\", Allah urge true Muslims who want to reach higher degrees and compete to satisfy their Lord to pay more money from their wealth as \"sadakat\". This is not a must. But it is too much recommended for whoever seeks the highest degrees. Many verses talk about this in Qur'an. Allah compare those who pay this extra money to the poor as if they were giving a loan to their creator and He will multiply it for them as many times as He wish in the Hereafter.\nMany verses in Qur’an tell us this fact and encourage us in a very attractive way to pay “sadakat” to the poor:\n( 11 )\tWho is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He will multiply it for him and he will have a noble reward?\nAl Hadid – no. 57 – verse 11\n( 245 ) Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? And it is Allah who withholds and grants abundance, and to Him you will be returned.\nAl Baqarah – no.2 – verse 245\nExplanation: Do you think that Allah, the creator who own everything need a loan from you? Definitely, not. He is only making a metaphor to show you how he will reward you for this in the Hereafter. And to show you how He like this act from you so much. Again, it is the test. Allah could make everyone very rich. It is so easy for Him, but He is testing some people with fortunes and wealth and testing others with poverty and deprivation.\nAlso, these sayings by the prophet warn wealthy people in this life that they will be the lowest and the poorest in the Hereafter unless they abide by his advice:\nAbu Dharr reported:\nI went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he was sitting under the shade of the Ka'ba. As he saw me he said: By the Lord of the Ka'ba, they are the losers. I came there till I sat and I could not stay (longer) and (then) stood up. I said: Messenger of Allah, let my father, be ransom for you, who are they (the losers)? He said: They are those having a huge amount of wealth except so and so and (those who spend their wealth generously on them whom they find in front of them, behind them and on their right side and on their left side) and they are a few. And no owner of camels, or cattle or goat and sheep, who does not pay Zakat (would be spared punishment) but these (camels, cattle, goats and sheep) would come on the Day of Resurrection wearing more flesh and would gore him with their horns and trample them with their hooves. And when the last one would pass away, the first one would return (to trample him) till judgment would be pronounced among people.\nSahih Muslim 990 a\nIn-book reference\nBook 12, Hadith 37\nIt was narrated from Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “The wealthiest will be the lowest on the Day of Resurrection, except those who do such and such with their money, and earn it from good sources.”\nSunan Ibn Majah 4130\nBook 37, Hadith 31 :\tIn-book reference\nEnglish translation\t: Vol. 5, Book 37, Hadith 4130\nAbu Dharr reported:\nI walked with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the stony ground of Medina in the afternoon and we were looking at Uhud. The Messenger of Allah (way peace by upon him) said: Abu Dharr! I said: Messenger of Allah, I am here at thy beck and call. He said: What I desire is that Uhud be gold with me and three nights should pass and there is left with me any dinar but one coin which I would keep to pay debt. (I love) to spend it among the servants of Allah like this and he pointed in front of him, and on his right side and on his left side. We then proceeded on and he said: Abu Dharr. I said: At thy beck and call, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: The rich would be poor on the Day of Resurrection, but he who spent like this and like this and like this, and he pointed as at the first time.\nSahih Muslim 94 c\nIn-book reference\t: Book 12, Hadith 41",

          "question": "What if I get a senior important job? What if I have authority, to be a manager, a minister, a political party leader …. etc.? What is Islam's stance on this? Does Islam encourage or discourage Muslims if they get jobs with authority?",
          "answer": "Prophet Muhammad instructed us in \"Sunnah\" to get away from authority and positions as far as we can, especially if we are not up to the responsibility and cannot perform it fully and honestly.\nAuthority may look nice and tempting in this life but it becomes a huge burden and a heavy responsibility when you die and in the Hereafter. The only exception to this, is when it is offered to you and you did not ask for it. And you feel that you can perform its duties honestly. Otherwise, do not seek it in any way.\nMany \"hadeeths\" in Sunnah talk about this advice:\n(5)Chapter: Prohibition of Asking for Governorship It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that :\nThe Prophet [SAW] said: \"You will be keen for governorship but it will be regret and loss on the Day of Resurrection. What a good position it is when they are alive, but how miserable their state when they die (and leave it behind).\"\nSunan an-Nasa'i 5385 : Reference\nBook 49, Hadith 7 :\tIn-book reference\nEnglish translation\t: Vol. 6, Book 49, Hadith 5387\n(3) Chapter: The prohibition of seeking or desiring a position of authority\nIt has been reported on the authority of 'Abd al-Rahman b. Samura who said:\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: 'Abd al-Rahman, do not ask for a position of authority, for if you are granted this position as a result of your asking for it, you will be left alone (without God's help to discharge the responsibilities attendant thereon), and if you are granted it without making any request for it, you will be helped (by God in the discharge of your duties).\nSahih Muslim 1652c :\nBook 33, Hadith 15 :\tIn-book reference\nUSC-MSA web (English) reference\t: Book 20, Hadith 4487\nChapter: It is disliked to be appointed to a position of authority unnecessarily\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr who said:\nI said to the Prophet (ﷺ): Messenger of Allah, will you not appoint me to a public office? He stroked my shoulder with his hand and said: Abu Dharr, thou art weak and authority is a trust. and on the Day of judgment, it is a cause of humiliation and repentance except for one who fulfils its obligations and (properly) discharges the duties attendant thereon.\nSahih Muslim 1825 : Reference\nBook 33, Hadith 19 :\tIn-book reference\nUSC-MSA web (English) reference\t: Book 20, Hadith 4491",

          "question": "But I heard that Muslims have to pray 5 times every single day. They also must pay some money to the poor. In addition, they have to fast for one month every year. I think it is hard to abide by all these duties and be away from all the impermissible things in Islam. I feel I will be like a prisoner. What do you think?",
          "answer": "To be honest with you, the Muslim duties need patience and true believing especially at the beginning. But if you are a true believer, after some time, you will find your pleasure in these duties. And you will never feel they are hard. But first be patient and honest and a true believer. Then, Allah will help you.\nAnd you have to know that reaching Eternal Paradise is not that easy. It requires paying a high price. It needs piety, hard work, honesty and patience.\nSome \"Hadeeths\" show this fact clearly:\nThe Paradise is surrounded by hardships and the Hell-Fire is surrounded by temptations.\nSahih Muslim - Book 53, Hadith 1\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah said: \"When Allah created Paradise and Hell, He sent Jibril, peace be upon him, to Paradise and said: 'Look at it and at what I have prepared for its people in it.' He looked at it, then he came back\nand said: 'By Your Glory, no one will hear of it but he will enter it.' So He commanded that it be surrounded by hardships and said: 'Go and look at it and at what I have prepared for its people in it.' He looked at it and saw that it had been surrounded with hardships. He (Jibril) said: 'By Your Glory, I fear that no one will enter it.' He (Allah) said: 'Go and look at the Fire and at what I have prepared for its people in it.' So he looked at it and parts of it were piled upon other parts. He came back and said: 'By Your Glory, no one will enter it.' So He commanded that it be surrounded with pleasures and said: 'Go and look at it.' So he looked at it and saw that it was surrounded with pleasures. He came back and said: 'By Your Glory, I fear that no one will be saved from it and all will enter it.'\"\nSunan an-Nasa'i 3763 - Book 35, Hadith 3",

          "answer": "You can try three ways:\nFirst, try to find answers to some of the questions you asked me in other religions and beliefs. Compare my answers to theirs. Be objective. Unbiased comparison will show you the difference and make truisms and facts clearer to you.\nSecond, I advise you to read the whole Qur'an once. Read it with a short explanation from beginning to end. Or you could listen to some surahs. You will surely feel it is a divine revelation not a human language. I am not exaggerating if I say that whatever you like, you will find it in Qur’an. Long books could be written to describe the beauty of Qur’an and still these books will never give Qur’an its due respect. Briefly, I can tell you that Qur’an is a book of everything beautiful and everything infallible. No wonder since it is the true word of Allah.\nThird, try to read one of the short Sunnah books like “Riyad Al- Saliheen”. Read it with a short explanation. You will find an ocean of wisdom, a treasure of mercy and good behavior and a simple gate to happiness. It will benefit you in your life even if you do not embrace Islam.",

Look at the billions of people who speak different languages and have different colors and shapes and they are given food, water and livelihood at the same time everywhere. Consider, think over and ask yourself honestly. Is it possible that all this huge universe has no creator? Is it possible that all this came out of nothing or by accident? Be honest with yourself and give up arrogance and you will find the right way easily.\nThe following verses in Quran ask and challenge all humans about some basic questions. Read and think:\n( 35 ) Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]?\n( 36 ) Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain.\n( 37 ) Or have they the depositories [containing the provision] of your Lord? Or are they the controllers [of them]?\nAt Tur – no.52 – verse 35 – 37\n( 17 ) Then do they not look at the camels - how they are created?

This book includes (1905) hadeeths or sayings of prophet Muhammad. This book is recommended because it includes the most important sayings and actions of prophet Muhammad which are vital for any Muslim to know.\nThen, there are some important books that any Muslim should read and understand like:\n3.\tAn explanation for the the Islamic belief called \"Tahawiyya Islamic Doctrine\": This book is one of the most famous books which gives more details about the Islamic belief and gives citations from Qur'an and Sunnah.\n4.\t\"The facilitated Islamic Jurisprudence in the light of Qur'an and Sunnah\" : This is a simplified book in basic items of Islamic \" Fiqh\" or jurisprudence for the ordinary non- specialized Muslims.\n5.\t\t\"The biographies of the noblest men and women in Islam\" which is called in Arabic \"Nozhat Al-Fudala'a in siyarAa'lam Al-Nubala'a\": This book was written by \"Al-Zahaby\" and was simplified by \" Muhammad Hasan Akeel Mussa\". This book lets you know about the noblest and the greatest men and women in Islam and how they lived. This book gives any Muslim unforgettable and unimaginable real examples of very noble men and women. I think any Muslim needs this at a time when the examples for us have become \"actors, actresses, singers and football players\".\n6.\tFinally, you should read any simplified and authenticated book in the history of Islam to see how this religion started and how the early Muslims suffered unimaginable kinds of persecution and torture in order for this religion to come to us. You should know about the glorious days of Islam and how it controlled most of the world in less than 50 years from its outset. You should also know how it became weak again and how Muslims lost all power when they abandoned their religion.\nActually, reading history is a great benefit for anyone. It is full of lessons and morals and insight for the future. The future is no more than a repetition of the past incidents but with some difference in details. I think whoever studies the past and understands the present will definitely have some insight about the future.\nCertainly, there are many other books for whoever wants to specialize and become a scholar. Actually, Muslims have a treasure of books written by ancient and recent scholars. But the books I mentioned are only for\nthe ordinary non-specialized Muslim who wants to know the basics of his religion in a relatively short time.\nThis hadeeth is also relevant to your question:\nYahya related to me from Malik that he heard that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"I have left two matters with you. As long as you hold to them, you will not go the wrong way. They are the Book of Allah and the Sunna of His Prophet.\"\nMuwatta Malik\nArabic reference\t: Book 46, Hadith 1628\nUSC-MSA web (English) reference: Book 46, Hadith 3",

Also, don't forget that Allah chose to send His final revelation to humans in Arabic. In addition, He selected an Arab messenger from the Arab people who speak Arabic.\nAren't all these Divine selections and facts any motivations for you to learn Arabic?",

They love to be champions in sports or perform untraditional and courageous tasks or go on thrilling trips and tours or become famous actors or exceptional artists to enjoy their lives. I think there are thousands of these people around the world. How does Islam view these people?",
          "answer": "Islam is a very practical religion. Allah want you to use your time efficiently in something useful and fruitful for you, for your family, for your community and for Islam. Islam is not against fun and playing provided that it has the following conditions: it benefits you in your practical life or in your religion; It is not a waste of time; It is not against the general ethics and principles of Islam; It doesn't take you from your basic daily chores. If any activity or travelling or fun is congruous with the previous conditions. I think it is not forbidden in Islam.\nIn the following verses Allah allude to the fact that everything was created for a purpose. It was not made for fun or playing:\n( 38 ) And We did not create the heavens and earth and that between them in play.\n( 39 ) We did not create them except in truth, but most of them do not know.\nAd Dukhan – No. 44 – verse 38, 39\nIn the following hadeeth, Prophet Muhammad (MPBUH) warns us that any human being will be asked about how he spent his time, how he spent his money; What he did with his wealth and his knowledge.\nAbu Barzah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:\nMessenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Man's feet will not move on the Day of Resurrection before he is asked about his life, how did he consume it, his knowledge, what did he do with it, his wealth, how did he earn it and how did he dispose of it, and about his body, how did he wear it out.\"\n[At-Tirmidhi, who classified it as Hadith Hasan Sahih]. Riyad as-Salihin 407 : Reference\nIn-book reference\t: Introduction, Hadith 407\nIn the following hadeeths, the prophet (PBUH) tells us about the sports and activities Allah like for you and will reward you for doing them:\nIt was narrated from ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir Al-Juhani that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:\n“Allah will admit three people to Paradise by virtue of one arrow: The one who makes it, seeking reward by making it well; the one who shoots it; and the one who hands it to him.” And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Shoot and ride, and if you shoot that is dearer to me than if you ride. All things that a Muslim man does for entertainment are in vain except for shooting arrows, training his horse and playing with his wife, for these are things that bring reward.”\nSunan Ibn Majah 2811 : Reference\nBook 24, Hadith 59 :\tIn-book reference\nEnglish translation\t: Vol. 4, Book 24, Hadith 2811\nNarrated Salama:\nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) passed by some people from the tribe of Aslam practicing archery. He said, \"O children of Ishmael! Throw (arrows), for your father was an archer. I am on the side of Bani so-and so,\" meaning one of the two teams. The other team stopped throwing, whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"What has happened to them?\" They replied, \"How shall we throw while you are with Bani so-and so?\" He said, \"Throw for I am with all of you.\"\nAl-Bukhary - Book 61, Hadith 17",

          "question": "But some people encounter big calamities and misfortunes in this life. These misfortunes are too hard for them to bear. So, they feel desperate and may commit suicide. Does Islam offer any help for this kind of desperate people?",
          "answer": "The true belief in Allah and his fate enables people to bear and adapt with misfortunes and calamities in this life. A Muslim's belief that this life is only a short one that is followed by a thorough accounting is satisfying. A Muslim’s belief that everything that happens to him in this life was destined by Allah 50 thousand years before the Earth and heavens were created render all its calamities and misfortunes acceptable.\nAllah explain this concept in the following verses:\n( 22 ) No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before We bring it into being - indeed that, for Allah, is easy -\n( 23 ) In order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult [in pride] over what He has given you. And Allah does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful -\nAl Hadid – No. 57 – verses 22 – 23\nIn the following hadeeth prophet Muhammad (PBUH) promises Muslims with big rewards for their patience on the most minor troubles\nAbu Sa'id and Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:\n\"Never a believer is stricken with a discomfort, an illness, an anxiety, a grief or mental worry or even the pricking of a thorn but Allah will expiate his sins on account of his patience\".\n[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]\nRiyad as-Salihin – Book 1 – no. 37\nIntroduction, Hadith 37\nIn the following hadeeth prophet Muhammad PBUH instructs Muslims never to hope for death whatever was the troubles in which they are involved. Instead, he teaches Muslims a supplication to say in this case\nAnas (b. Malik) reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying. None of you should make a request for death because of the trouble in which he is involved, but if there is no other help to it, then say:\nO Allah, keep me alive as long as there is goodness in life for me and bring death to me when there is goodness in death for me.

          "answer": "In order to be truly guided, one needs to get rid of his arrogance and to read and understand without pride or prejudice. If you do this, Allah will open your heart to righteousness. All hearts are controlled by Allah, the creator.\nThe following verse sheds light on this idea:\n\"( 125 ) So whoever Allah wants to guide - He expands his breast to [contain] Islam; and whoever He wants to misguide - He makes his breast tight and constricted as though he were climbing into the sky. Thus does Allah place defilement upon those who do not believe.\"\nAl An'am– no. 6 – verse 125\nArrogance and sins and injustice are thick barriers against accepting Islam. Allah punishes arrogant, tyrant and unfair people by closing their hearts so that they will never accept the light of Islam. They will always be in darkness as a result of their behavior.\nThe following verse shows this meaning:\n( 25 ) And among them are those who listen to you, but We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And if they should see every sign, they will not believe in it. Even when they come to you arguing with you, those who disbelieve say, \"This is not but legends of the former peoples.\" Al An'am– no. 6 – verse 25",

But, in the end, it is up to their discretion to believe or not.\nThe following verses explain this idea:\n\"( 17 ) O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befalls you. Indeed, [all] that is of the matters [requiring] determination.\"\nLuqman – no. 31 – verse 17\n\"( 110 ) You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah. If only the People of the Scripture had believed, it would have been better for them. Among them are believers, but most of them are defiantly disobedient.\"\nAl 'Imran– no.3 – verse 110\n\"( 164 ) And when a community among them said, \"Why do you advise [or warn] a people whom Allah is [about] to destroy or to punish with a severe punishment?\" they [the advisors] said, \"To be absolved before your Lord and perhaps they may fear Him.\"\nAl A'raf– no. 7 – verse 164",

          "answer": "It is your duty to advise and show the way only. It is not your duty to force any one to accept your religion. People should make their own choice. Allah, the creator Himself did not force any one to accept His religion. You only advise and warn. If they insist on being atheists, it is their business of course. They will be accountable for this.\nThe following verses show the answer clearly:\n\"( 23 ) You, [O Muhammad], are not but a warner.\n( 24 ) Indeed, We have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And there was no nation but that there had passed within it a warner.\n( 25 ) And if they deny you - then already have those before them denied.

And if He know wickedness and arrogance in their hearts are prevailing, He will close their hearts from accepting the right belief. So, your job is only to try the guidance.\nThe following verses shed a light on these wise ideas:\n( 56 ) Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided.\nAl Qasas– no.28 – verse 56\n( 3 ) Perhaps, [O Muhammad], you would kill yourself with grief that they will not be believers.\n( 4 ) If We willed, We could send down to them from the sky a sign for which their necks would remain humbled.\nAsh Shu'ara– no. 26 – verse 3,4",

          "question": "But when you try to guide people to the right belief and advise them to avoid the wrong belief, it is risky and one may be harmed or in danger? What does Islam say about this?",
          "answer": "Definitely, you may face bullying and danger, but you should be patient because it is done in the cause of Allah. And He will reward you bountifully. Your efforts will be highly evaluated by Allah if you are honest and truthful. You will never force anyone to believe. It is up to them. You are only explaining, inviting and warning them from Allah’s punishment.\nThe following verses allude to these ideas:\n\"( 142 ) Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while Allah has not yet made evident those of you who fight in His cause and made evident those who are steadfast?\"\nAl 'Imran– no. 3 – verse 142\n\"( 12 ) And why should we not rely upon Allah while He has guided us to our [good] ways. And we will surely be patient against whatever harm you should cause us. And upon Allah let those who would rely [indeed] rely.\"\nIbrahim – no.14 – verse 12\n\"( 108 ) Say, \"O mankind, the truth has come to you from your Lord, so whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul, and whoever goes astray only goes astray [in violation] against it.

          "question": "Some people in our age are very proud of the human mind, science and technology. These people assume that the human mind, Science and technology have the potential to control everything and overcome even death itself and make life much happier. What do you think?",
          "answer": "Look around you. Do you think technology and advanced science have controlled anything or made life happier? Pandemics are still killing millions of people. Hurricanes of different kinds are still destroying whole cities and villages. Many diseases are still without a medicine. Doctors have managed to develop only painkillers not medicines.\nEven the vaccines that were prepared to face dangerous diseases depend on the Immune System inside the human body to create and activate natural antibiotics for the disease.\nLet them bring back the dead people. Let them save their beloved from old age or from death. Even, let them create “a fly” if they could. Allah challenged those we invoke beside Allah whether humans or idols to use all their powers and science altogether to create “a fly”, one of the beings we despise but they will never be able to\nListen to the verse that has the challenge:\n( 73 ) O people, an example is presented, so listen to it. Indeed, those you invoke besides Allah will never create [as much as] a fly, even if they gathered together for that purpose. And if the fly\nshould steal away from them a [tiny] thing, they could not recover it from him. Weak are the pursuer and pursued.\n( 74 ) They have not appraised Allah with true appraisal. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might.\nAl-Hajj- no. 22 – verse 73,74\nTo cut it short for you, ask yourself who created the human mind they are bragging about? And who created for them the elements inside the Earth that they are using to develop and invent. It is very obvious for any mindful man that everything is coming from Allah and everything is going to Him and everything is controlled by Him. And humanity is very vulnerable and helpless.",

          "question": "Which factors or circumstances -do you think- are most dangerous on my future as a Muslim if I convert?",
          "answer": "Arrogance and vain are the most dangerous enemies to man. When he feels he is strong, intelligent or rich, he wants to understand everything with his mind. Here comes the fatal mistake. When he tries to explain everything using his mind, his mind fails him and he loses trust in his creator and becomes an atheist. This fatal mistake was done by millions before you. Try to avoid it. Keep your mind away from five areas. These are red lines for any human mind:\n1.\tThinking about the Divine-self of the creator. This is beyond our limited mind. And it will surely lead to atheism. When Satan urges you to think about Allah's Divine self or what He look like or such questions remember this verse in Qur'an:\n\"There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.\"\nAsh-Shura– no. 42 – verse11\nAlso put this warning from prophet Muhammad into your consideration:\nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Satan comes to one of you and says, 'Who created so-and-so? 'Till he says, 'Who has created your Lord?' So, when he inspires such a question, one should seek refuge with Allah and give up such thoughts.\"\nSahih al-Bukhari - Book 59, Hadith 85\nAlways remember that Allah started everything and created everything. And nothing was there before Him. Always remember that you can know Allah from his creatures in this universe and from his innumerable blessings but not from thinking about his Divine Self which is beyond our minds. It is a very dangerous red-line. It will lead you to nothing. So, beware.\n2.\tThinking about Allah's destiny: Why he did this? And why he made this in such a way? And why he ordered this…. etc. You will never understand Allah's wisdom. So, submit and trust to avoid atheism and be sure Allah will never be unjust with you or anyone else as he said in this verse:\n\"( 40 ) Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.\"\nAn Nisa – no. 4 – verse 40\n3.\tThinking about the \"unspecific\" verses of Qur'an and insisting on understanding their explanations before you embrace Islam.\nFor example:\n( 1 ) Alif, Lam, Meem\"\nAl Baqarah- no.2 – verse 1\nAnd such separated letters at the beginning of some suras. And some other verses. This is very dangerous. Most probably, you will never understand their meanings. Only Allah know their real meanings. And maybe a minority of great scholars understand them. Allah has intended them to be a test for those who have little trust in their creator as Allah said in this verse:\n\"( 7 ) It is He who has sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific. As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them].\nAnd no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, \"We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.\" And no one will be reminded except those of understanding.\"\nAl 'Imran– no. 3 – verse 7\n4.\tThinking about Allah's legislation: Why he wanted us to pray this number of prayers at these specific times? Why he wanted us to make Hajj in such a way and kiss a stone in Ka'baa? And why he wanted us to fast in Ramadan and stop eating and drinking for a specific time every day? Why he made this permissible? And why he made this impermissible? And hundreds of similar questions that arise to our minds. If you believe in Allah and that he is all-knowing and all-wise. Do not keep asking such questions. Only follow his orders. This is what we call \"Iman\" or \"true belief\" as we said before.\nIt is not bad to think about the wisdom behind a specific legislation. If you understand the wisdom behind some legislations, it is good. But, if you cannot understand and this will happen for sure, submit to your creator and say \"We heard and we obeyed\".\nDefinitely, your limited mind will never be able to understand the wisdom behind every legislation.\n5.\tDo not listen to hypocrites or false scholars: If you convert to Islam, you will always find Muslim hypocrites or ignorant thinkers who come on TV channels and speak against Islam and bring some Hadeeths or verses and try to show you that they are contradicted and that Islam is unfair for one reason or another. Do not listen to such ignorant hypocrites. And when you find something confusing in your religion, go to a true scholar and ask him. Do this either face to face or online. But never take your religion from ignorant hypocrites who sold their belief and religion in return for a few dollars on some TV channels.",

If you find someone attacking Al-Bukhari or Muslim or such mother books in Sunnah, be sure he is a hypocrite who sold his religion with a bunch of dollars. And never listen to him.\nThose people are probably hired by organizations or countries to attack Islam strongly and make the young generations skeptical about their belief.",

          "answer": "As mentioned previously, if a person openly attacks foundational books of the Sunnah such as Sahih al-Bukhari or Sahih Muslim, then this is a serious indication that he has deviated from the authentic teachings of Islam. Such individuals should not be trusted or followed.\n\nMany of these figures are promoted by certain media outlets to create confusion and skepticism among Muslims, especially the younger generations, regarding their faith and its authentic sources. In many cases, these attacks are driven by personal interests, ideological agendas, or external influences rather than sincere scholarly concern.\n\nThroughout Islamic history, the Sunnah and its major compilations have been preserved through rigorous scientific methodologies, including chains of narration, critical evaluation of narrators, and scholarly consensus. Attempts to discredit these sources are not new; rather, they are part of recurring efforts to weaken Islamic belief by undermining its primary references.\n\nTherefore, Muslims are advised to rely on the Qur’an and the authentic Sunnah as understood and preserved by trustworthy scholars, and not to be misled by voices that attack Islam’s foundational texts under the guise of intellectual reform or free thinking.",

          "question": "Can you tell me a short piece of advice that you consider essential whether I convert or not?",
          "answer": "One thing I want you to remember always:\n-\t\tYou will be the only winner or the only loser by your belief or disbelief\n-\t\tAllah will never be harmed by your disbelief because He is the owner, the creator and the lord of everything. He is the one who give life and death and He is the one who give and deny everything in-between. Every tiny blessing with you is from Allah. You actually own nothing. And you can create nothing. So how can He be harmed by your disbelief?\n-\t\tLikewise, all the other people in this world will not be harmed by your disbelief. And they will not benefit anything from your belief because every one of them will be evaluated according to his own deeds.\nThe following verses manifest this concept plainly:\n\"( 7 )\tIf you disbelieve - indeed, Allah is Free from need of you. And He does not approve for His servants disbelief. And if you are grateful, He approves it for you; and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you about what you used to do. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.\"\nAz Zumar– no. 39 – verse 7\n\"( 170 ) O Mankind, the Messenger has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe; it is better for you. But if you disbelieve - then indeed, to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth. And ever is Allah Knowing and Wise.\"\nAn Nisa – no. 4 – verse 170\nThe following hadeeth is very important and relevant to your question. Note the part written in bold type carefully:\nAbu Dharr reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:\nMy servants, I have made oppression unlawful for Me and unlawful for you, so do not commit oppression against one another. My servants, all of you are liable to err except one whom I guide on the right path, so seek right guidance from Me so that I should direct you to the right path. O My servants, all of you are hungry (needy) except one whom I feed, so beg food from Me, so that I may give that to you. O My servants, all of you are naked (need clothes) except one whom I provide garments, so beg clothes from Me, so that I should clothe you. O My servants, you commit error night and day and I am there to pardon your sins, so beg pardon from Me so that I should grant you pardon. O My servants, you can neither do Me any harm nor can you do Me any good. O My servants, even if the first amongst you and the last amongst you and even the whole of human race of yours, and that of jinns even, become (equal in) God-conscious like the heart of a single person amongst you, nothing would add to My Power. O My servants, even if the first amongst you and the last amongst you and the whole human race of yours and that of the Jinns too in unison become the most wicked (all beating) like the heart of a single person, it would cause no loss to My Power. O My servants, even if the first amongst you and the last amongst you and the whole human race of yours and that of jinns also all stand in one plain ground and you ask Me and I confer upon every person what he asks for, it would not. in any way, cause any loss to Me (even less) than that which is caused to the ocean by dipping the needle in it. My servants, these for you I shall reward you for thern, so he who deeds of yours which I am recording finds good should praise Allah and he who does not find that should not blame anyone but his ownself.

This is done by declaring that \"there is no god except one God and Muhammad is the messenger of God.\" In a broader sense, anyone who willingly submits to the will of God is a Muslim. Thus, all the prophets preceding the prophet Muhammad are considered Muslims. The Quran specifically mentions Abraham who lived long before Moses and Christ that, \"he was not a Jew or a Christian but a Muslim,\" because, he had submitted to the will of God. Thus there are Muslims who are not submitting at all to the will of God and there are Muslims who are doing their best to live an Islamic life. One cannot judge Islam by looking at those individuals who have a Muslim name but in their actions, they are not living or behaving as Muslims. The extent of being a Muslim can be according to the degree to which one is submitting to the will of God, in his beliefs and his actions.",

His ancestry goes back to Prophet Ishmael (Peace be upon him), son of Prophet Abraham (Peace be upon him). His father died before his birth and his mother died when he was six. He did not attend a formal school since he was raised first by a nurse as it was the custom those days, and then by his grandfather and uncle. As a young man, he was known as a righteous person who used to meditate in a cave. At age 40, he was given the prophethood when the angel, Gabriel, appeared in the cave. Subsequently, the revelations came over 23 years and were compiled in the form of a book called the Quran which Muslims consider as the final and the last word of God. The Quran has been preserved, unchanged, in its original form and confirms the truth in the Torah, the psalms and the Gospel. (1)",

This revelation, which continued for twenty- three years, is known as the Quran. As soon as he began to recite the words he heard from Gabriel, and to preach the truth that God had revealed to him, he and his small group of followers suffered bitter persecution, which grew so fierce that in the year 622 God gave them the command to emigrate. This event, the Hijrah, 'migration', in which they left Makkah for the city of Madinah some 260 miles to the north, marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. After several years, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his followers were able to return to Makkah, where they forgave their enemies and established Islam definitively. Before the Prophet (peace be upon him) died at the age of 63, the greater part of Arabia was Muslim, and within a century of his death Islam had spread to Spain in the West and as Far East as China.",

It was memorized by Muhammad (peace be upon him) and then dictated to his companions, and written down by scribes, who crosschecked it during his lifetime. Not one word of its 114 Surahs, has been changed over the centuries, so that the Quran is in every detail the unique and miraculous text which was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) fourteen centuries ago.",

The Quran, while revealed 1400 years ago contains scientific facts, which are only now being discovered. It is not in contradiction to science. 5- Allah has challenged the world to produce the like of the Quran. And He says they won't be able to. 6- Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the most influential man in history. In the book \"The 100 most influential men in History\", written by non- Muslim, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was #1. Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) was #3. It should be noted that even the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) was a prophet sent by Allah.",

(Qur an, 60:8) There is no compulsion in religion. (2:214) It is one of the functions of Islamic law to protect the privileged status of minorities, and this is why non- Muslim places of worship have flourished all over the Islamic world. History provides many examples of Muslim tolerance towards other faiths. For example, when the caliph Omar entered Jerusalem in the year 634, he granted amnesty to all and sanctioned freedom of worship to all religious communities in the city. Another example is Muslims who ruled the Spain had such tolerance of other beliefs that the Golden Age of Jewish Civilization flourished under the Muslim rule. Not only that, Islamic law permits non-Muslim minorities to set up their own courts thus allowing them the autonomy to be judged according to their family law.",

God's other gifts to him included healing the blind and the sick, reviving the dead, making a bird out of clay and most importantly, the message he was carrying. These miracles were given to him by God to establish him as a prophet. According to the Quran, he was not crucified but was raised into Heaven. (Quran, Chapter Maryam)",

These pillars are 1) the belief (Iman) in one God and that Muhammad (P) is His messenger, 2) prayer (Salat) which are prescribed five times a day, 3) fasting (Siyam) which is required in the month of Ramadan, 4) charity (Zakat) which is the poor-due on the wealth of the rich and 5) hajj which is the pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime if one can afford it physically and financially. All the pillars should be of equal height and strength in a building in order to give the building its due shape and proportions. It is not possible that one would do hajj without observing fasting or without practicing regular prayers. Now think of a building which has pillars only. It would not be called a building. In order to make it a building, it has to have a roof, it has to have walls, it has to have doors and windows. These things in Islam are the moral codes of Islam such as honesty, truthfulness, steadfastness and many other human moral qualities. Thus in order to be a Muslim, one should not only be practicing the pillars of Islam but should also have the highest possible attribute for being a good human being. Only then the building is completed and looks beautiful.",

While it is true that in many places where Muslim armies went to liberate people or the land, they did carry the sword as that was the weapon used at that time. However, Islam did not spread by the sword because in many places where there are Muslims now, in the Far East like Indonesia, in China, and many parts of Africa, there are no records of any Muslim armies going there. To say that Islam was spread by the sword would be to say that Christianity was spread by guns, F-16's and atomic bombs, etc., which is not true. Christianity spread by the missionary works of Christians. Ten- percent of all Arabs are Christians. The \"Sword of Islam\" could not convert all the non-Muslim minorities in Muslim countries. In India, where Muslims ruled for 700 years, they are still a minority. In the U.S.A., Islam is the fastest growing religion and has 6 million followers without any sword around.",

          "question": "Does Islam promote violence and terrorism?",
          "answer": "No. Islam is religion of peace and submission and stresses on the sanctity of human life. A verse in the Quran says, [Chapter 5, verse 32], that \"anyone who saves one life, it is as if he has saved the whole of mankind and anyone who has killed another person (except in lieu of murder or mischief on earth) it is as if he has killed the whole of mankind.\" Islam condemns all the violence which happened in the Crusades, in Spain, in WW II, or by acts of people like the Rev. Jim Jones, David Koresh, Dr. Baruch Goldstein, or the atrocities committed in Bosnia by the Christian Serbs. Anyone who is doing violence is not practicing his religion at that time. However, sometimes violence is a human response of oppressed people as it happens in Palestine. Although this is wrong, they think of this as a way to get attention. There is a lot of terrorism and violence in areas where there is no Muslim presence. For example, in Ireland, South Africa, Latin America, and Sri Lanka. Sometimes the violence is due to a struggle between those who have with those who do not have, or between those who are oppressed with those who are oppressors. We need to find out why people become terrorists. Unfortunately, the Palestinians who are doing violence are called terrorists, but not the armed Israeli settlers when they do the same sometimes even against their own people. As it turned out to be in the Oklahoma City bombing, sometime Muslims are prematurely blamed even if the terrorism is committed by non-Muslims. Sometimes those who want Peace and those who oppose Peace can be of the same religion.",

          "answer": "There is no concept of \"Fundamentalism\" in Islam. The western media has coined this term to brand those Muslims who wish to return to the basic fundamental principles of Islam and mould their lives accordingly. Islam is a religion of moderation and a practicing God fearing Muslim can neither be a fanatic nor an extremist.",

          "answer": "In Islam, marriage is one of the most sacred bonds that two humans can forge. In addition, a marriage in Islam is also practical involving legal agreement and contractual obligations which spouses mutually agreed upon. According to Islam, no Muslim girl or boy can be forced to marry against their will. Parents are to play a proactive and active role in suggesting potential spouses, but not to impose a decision upon their children.",

          "question": "Does Islam promote polygamy?",
          "answer": "No, polygamy in Islam is a permission not an injunction. Historically, all the prophets except Jesus, who was not married, had more than one wife. For Muslim men to have more than one wife is a permission which is given to them in the Quran, not to satisfy lust, but for the welfare of the widows and the orphans of the wars. In the pre-Islamic period, men used to have many wives. One person had 11 wives and when he became Muslim, he asked the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), \"What should I do with so many wives?\" and he said, \"Divorce all except the four.\" The Quran says, \"you can marry 2 or 3 and up to 4 women if you can be equally just with each of them\" (4:3). Since it is very difficult to be equally just with all wives, in practice, most of the Muslim men do not have more than one wife. Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) himself from age 24 to 50 was married to only one woman, Khadija. In the western society, some men who have one wife have many extramarital affairs. Thus, a survey was published in \"U.S.A. Today\" (April 4, 1988 Section D) which asked 4,700 mistresses what they would like their status to be. They said that \"they preferred being a second wife rather than the 'other woman' because they did not have the legal rights, nor did they have the financial equality of the legally married wives, and it appeared that they were being used by these men.\"",

          "question": "Does Islam oppress women?",
          "answer": "No. On the contrary, Islam elevated the status of women 1,400 years ago by giving them the right to divorce, the right to have financial independence and support and the right to be identified as dignified women (Hijab) when in the rest of the world, including Europe, women had no such rights. Women are equal to men in all acts of piety (Quran 33:32). Islam allows women to keep their maiden name after marriage, their earned money and spend it as they wish, and ask men to be their protector as women on the street can be molested. Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) told Muslim men, \"the best among you is the one who is best to his family.\" Not Islam, but some Muslim men, do oppress women today. This is because of their cultural habits or their ignorance about their religion.",

          "answer": "Islam recognizes the rights of the minority. To ensure their welfare and safety, Muslim rulers initiated a tax (Jazia) on them. Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) forbade Muslim armies to destroy churches and synagogues. Caliph Umer did not even allow them to pray inside a church. Jews were welcomed and flourished in Muslim Spain even when they were persecuted in the rest of Europe. They consider that part of their history as the Golden Era. In Muslim countries, Christians live in prosperity, hold government positions and attend their church. However, the same religious tolerance is not always available to Muslim minorities as seen in the past during Spanish inquisition and the crusades, or as seen now by the events in Bosnia, Israel and India. Muslims do recognize that sometimes the actions of a ruler does not reflect the teachings of his religion.",

Islam encourages marriage as a shield to such temptations and as a means of having mutual love, mercy and peace. b. Abortion: Islam considers abortion as murder and does not permit it except to save the mother's life (Quran 17:23-31, 6:15 1). c. Homosexuality and AIDS: Islam categorically opposes homosexuality and considers it a sin. However, Muslim physicians are advised to care for AIDS patients with compassion just as they would for other patients. d. Euthanasia and Suicide: Islam is opposed to both suicide and euthanasia. Muslims do not believe in heroic measures to prolong the misery in a terminally ill patient. e. Organ transplantation: Islam stresses upon saving lives (Quran 5:32); thus, transplantation in general would be considered permissible in necessity provided a donor consent is available.

Muslims are told to treat them with respect and justice and do not fight with them unless they initiate hostilities or ridicule their faith. The Muslims ultimate hope is that they all will join them in worshipping one God and submit to His will. \"Say (O Muhammad): O people of the Book (Jews and Christians) come to an agreement between us and you, that we shall worship none but Allah, and that we shall take no partners with Him, and none of us shall take others for Lords beside Allah. And if they turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are those who have surrendered (unto Him).\" (Quran 3:64) What about Hindus, Bahai, Buddhists and members of other religions? They should also be treated with love, respect, and understanding to make them recipients of Invitations to Islam.",

[An-Nisa: 1] He says: ((Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and night there are signs for people of reason.(190) ˹They are˺ those who remember Allah while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth ˹and pray˺, “Our Lord! You have not created ˹all of˺ this without purpose. Glory be to You! Protect us from the torment of the Fire. (191)) [Al-Imran: 190-191] You find great emphasis that in contemplating Allah's creation leads to the knowledge of God and the truth of what the prophets brought of a promising punishment to the unbelievers. And because creation is the clearest indication of God and the most prominent proof of His lordship, the prophets (peace be upon them) taught the people about their Lord through the (evidence) of the creation. For example, here is Abraham, peace be upon him, teaching his people of God, he said: ((He replied, “In fact, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who created them ˹both˺. And to that I bear witness.”)) [Surah Al-Anbiya: 56] And this is Moses, peace be upon him, answering the question of Pharaoh (He answered, “Our Lord is the One Who has given everything its ˹distinctive˺ form, then guided ˹it˺.”) [Surah Taha: 50] It appears from all of the above: that creatures indicate their Creator, and call for faith in Him and His oneness, lordship, divinity and perfection of His attributes, and that the Quran determines this issue best and confirms it with the clearest confirmation. Inference of creation about the Creator is a legal and valid method and also a correct mentality: 1) It is legitimately correct; because the Quran has shown it, directed and guided people to it. 2) It is intellectually correct; because of the fact that a person was brought into (after he was nothing), and created from sperm and then from a leech. People didn’t know this from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but they found this out with their minds, whether the Prophet told them or not. So, what is meant here: is to show that knowledge is a way to lead to faith in God the Creator.",

          "question": "Can you prove the existence of God with other evidence?",
          "answer": "The evidence is abundant, and we mention some of them: First evidence: The evidence of origination (bringing into existence), and its meaning: That everything that is Muhdath (brought into being after it did not exist) must have a producer, a Moojid (originator), so everything that is brought into existence is direct evidence of the originator. For example: Let's look at Google. There must be an internet to use Google, in order for there to be internet we need our computer, phones or tablets, and for the computer, well, someone had to build it, and there are things that depend on electricity. The next question is Google depends on the Internet, the Internet depends on the computer, the computer depends on us and electricity. The process goes on and on. We can't have infinite dependent things. There's a place where it must stop so it can be logical, and that is the necessary and self-sufficient independent being who is God. Second evidence: The evidence of tendency (and attention), which is that everything in existence carries a degree of functional complexity, i.e. performs a specialized function and a specific task, and functional complexity is a guide to making and bringing into existence. So there must be an originator. For example: A light bulb consists of: a lamp filament, a lead wire that conducts electricity to the filament, inert gas which protects the wick and doesn’t interact with the electricity, and glass which prevents air entering or inert gas from exiting, otherwise the wick would have burned. And the lamp base that connects the bulb to the rotary and forms a path of electric current. Here the light bulb is a system of complexity that cannot be simplified, and therefore has a primary mental (logical) significance which gives meaning to a mastered manufacture (production) which denies the elaborate workmanship of the lamp or assumes its appearance by chance is the one who demands evidence of this.",

If there is more than one Creator, the question is how can you have one necessary self-sufficient and independent being if there is another God, then he is a follower and not necessary. So the question is: If there were two Creators first, God, the Almighty, says in the Quran: (Had there been other gods besides Allah in the heavens or the earth, both ˹realms˺ would have surely been corrupted. So Glorified is Allah, Lord of the Throne, far above what they claim.) [Al-Anbiya: 22] That is, they will fight each other for power, that is, the two forces will fight each other because they are subordinate and not independent, because it needs more power to kill the other, which is why we believe that there must be one necessary being who is self-sufficient, independent and necessary.",

Absolutely not, this is a contradiction, it is like asking how many days are in a week? Yes or no? It is not a yes or no question, how many days are in a week? Seven. So your question is wrong in itself, so to ask can God create a rock of this size and not lift it? This means that the moment he created this rock he became weak (unstrong) because he could not carry it and there is no such thing, as this is a question that does not make sense. These questions that pertain to God's creation, such as: Can God create a rock that He cannot lift? Can God cease to exist? These questions cannot be asked because they are corrupt questions.",

          "question": "God doesn't need us, so why did He create us?",
          "answer": "The idea that needfulness (necessity) means frivolity is absurd! Needfulness is matched with wisdom, not absurdity. For example: A wealthy doctor with a good reputation may treat people without needing anything from them, but he treats them for their own benefit and here we do not describe his act as absurd! The wisdom and the great purpose behind the action do not revolve in the cycle of need nor in vain! A swimmer may save a child with mercy and then leave him and go without waiting for the praise of the child's parents. And here his act is not classified as a need or in vain, but is a generous act and a noble purpose and a good creation, so there is no correlation between needfulness and absurdity! And the patient's ignorance of the doctor's wisdom does not mean that the doctor's decisions are absurd. Knowledge of divine wisdom does not require an understanding of all dimensions of wisdom, but it is sufficient to understand some of them! It is enough to know that we are entrusted, the requirements of this entrustment, and to know the existence of this Divine wisdom, so this is enough for us, otherwise we are like the one who disbelieves in what he does not understand. The Almighty said: (In fact, they ˹hastily˺ rejected the Book without comprehending it and before the fulfillment of its warnings. Similarly, those before them were in denial. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers!) [Yunus: 39] So God is wise and created us for a wise reason - Glory be to Him - God is in no need of anyone. Our endeavor, effort and work are only for ourselves. The Almighty said: (And whoever strives ˹in Allah’s cause˺, only does so for their own good. Surely Allah is not in need of ˹any of˺ His creation) [ Al-Ankabut: 6] As submission to God is the opposite of submission (slavery) in our concept. Slavery (submission) in our concept is that the master takes the good from the slave, but slavery to God is the exact opposite, which is that the master gives the slave a lot of bliss. When God says, (I have not created the Jinn and mankind except to worship me) it means that I did not create the jinn and mankind except to give them love, goodness, dignity and pride. God does not need our worship, rather we are the ones who need this worship, honor, talents and goods that have no limits. God the Generous allowed us to enter (knock at his door) anytime without an appointment.",

          "answer": "We use our logic, and our minds. Science deals with the five senses of what you can see through experimentation so what we say is very simple. There are scientists who believe in things also. If you say, for example, I don't see God and so I don't believe in Him, you know, this is not something scientific. Science does not talk about the supernatural, science depends on experiment. But we know, for example, scientists recently discovered dark matter, which is something they cannot see, touch, feel, smell, or hear, and the same applies to God, can you see God? No. Can you touch God? No. Can you smell God? No. Do you hear God? No. Can you see God? No, but you reject its existence. But the same thing with dark matter and yet you believe in its existence, what kind of contradiction is this? God does not exist because I cannot touch or feel Him but dark matter exists, this is a contradiction. You know, there were people who believed in God, and these were scientists, you know, like Einstein, you know, he believed in a higher power. So this matter of science or scientists with (the belief of) God, contains no contradiction. There can be Muslim or Christian scientists, yes, this is not a discovery. We know from the teachings of Muhammad, peace be upon him, that no one has ever actually seen God- at least not in this lifetime. Nor are we able to use our senses to make some kind of contact with Him. However, we are encouraged in Islam to use our senses and our common sense to recognize that all of this universe could not possibly come into existence on its own. Someone had to design it all. and then put it into motion. That is beyond our ability to do, yet it is something that we can understand. We don't have to see an artist to recognize a painting, correct? So, if we see paintings without seeing artists painting them, in the same way, we can believe that Allah created everything without having to see Him (or touch, or hear, etc.).(1)",

          "question": "Why did God create evil?",
          "answer": "Looking at the ocean will reveal that good in the universe is the rule and evil is the exception, health is the rule, disease is the exception, and we spend most of our lives in health and get sick for only a few days. Similarly, earthquakes are mostly a few minutes in life on earth, which is counted in millions of years, as well as volcanoes, as well as wars which are short disturbances in the life of nations between long periods of peace, and then we see some good in all of that, the disease gives the body immunity and pain educates man on hardness and endurance, and earthquakes are an alternative to pressure inside the globe and protect the earth's crust from explosion and return mountains to their places and volcanoes take out minerals and riches from the belly of earth and make the soil of the earth fertile, and wars make nations come together in the form of alliances and the greatest inventions came out during atomic wars. Missiles and jets all was a result of wars, and from the venom of the snake comes medicine, and from the microbe we make the vaccine. Evil is the test by which we know ourselves, which is the affliction that determines our grades with God, and the whole world is one chapter of a novel that will abound in chapters. Death is not the end of the story, but its beginning, and it is not permissible to judge a play from one chapter nor to reject a book because the first page wasn’t to our liking. The judgment here is incomplete and complete wisdom can only be known in the end. Then what alternative does the questioner who mocks us imagine? Does he want to live a life without death, without disease, without old age, without deficiency, without helplessness, without limitations, without sorrows and without pain, does he ask for absolute perfection, he asks as he pleases, perfection belongs to God alone. And evil is something that is normal within divine obligation! It is surprising that the existence of evil is the greatest proof of the validity of the religious cause, and of the error of atheism. For if we were children of the material world, we would not grasp neither good nor evil, because according to the vision of atheism, we walk in strict material imperatives. Understanding evil means that we are not children of this world, and that we derive our understanding of the existence of evil. From an introduction other than the Darwinian materialistic introduction to existence! And not realizing some of the subtleties of the divine wisdom in the matter of affliction – not evil because there isn't pure evil in existence.",

          "question": "Do People Need Revelation (Religion)?",
          "answer": "Humanity needs revelation as it announces the existence of God and His Oneness. It also clarifies His nature (who He is) and provides us with a guide on how to live our lives. Take this simple example: Every time you buy an electronic or electrical device, what do you find in the box? A user manual! This manual shows you how to use the device correctly, includes warnings, dos and don'ts, recommendations, and more. Religion is the answer to the most important questions that concern humans. It answers every existential question (such as: Why am I here? What happens after death?). Religion is a correction of human beliefs. It is a return to the monotheism that all prophets called for. Today, Muslims are the only ones on earth who adhere to this monotheism. Moreover, even the fiercest atheist believes that truth is better than lies, right? The fiercest atheist believes that honesty is better than betrayal, right? These are concepts that do not originate from this material world, and nothing in the material world justifies their meaning. What is the meaning of honesty? What is the meaning of lying? If we analyze the depths of the atom, will we find meanings such as honesty or lying? These are terms that do not belong to this material world, but they are real concepts. In fact, they are the most important things in existence. The value of a human lies in their morals, not in their physical size, the number of their atoms, or the energy levels of their cells. The value of a human is in the divine obligation within them. There is a good person and a corrupt person. But there is no good mountain or corrupt mountain. We do not observe an honest planet or a traitorous planet. Humans alone embody value, purpose, and the meaning of existence. Humans alone are capable of comprehending existence. The Quran, which is the final revelation from God, is an instructional guide for humanity. It contains life lessons, such as saving lives, being kind to neighbors, giving to charity, avoiding intoxicants, refraining from gambling, not lying, and much more. It also includes wisdom, morals, lessons, history, stories, and so much more.",

          "question": "What is wrong with morals being a product of the brain or a society?",
          "answer": "The brain is made up of exactly the same physical components! No matter how complex the brain is or the complexity of the physical structures, the sum of zeros will only produce zero. No matter how many zeros are inflated or superimposed on top of each other. If matter knows neither good nor evil, so does the brain! Here's the question: How did the concept of good and evil get to the brain? What is the cerebral objection from exterminating all the people of the earth? What is the cerebral objection from introducing lower human races into animal cages? These questions are not answered by the physical brain by error or correction. The brain is completely morally neutral. Because it is composed of the same atoms as the earth. The brain has nothing to do with morality. Whereas the idea that society is the origin of morality is strange, because morality is subjective, and because it means man as a human being and not society as a society. If this were true, and we consider morality to be the product of society, the Nazis would be right in exterminating others because society sees that. It is therefore true that morality is independent of society. Right is right no matter if it’s a good or bad society. And wrong in wrong no it it’s a good or bad society. So morality has a meaning that goes beyond the brain and society.",

          "question": "Why is Muhammad not the inventor of Islam?",
          "answer": "How can you prove the truth of Muhammad? Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is true and means that he is truly the Prophet of Allah, the Quran is the word of Allah, resurrection is true, the angels are true, Paradise and Hell are true. As for a liar and not just an ordinary liar, but one who is used to lying, he has slandered Allah. (God forbid) We will know this from his conducts and actions, as these actions provide us with an explanation of why he claimed prophecy, if he was called to Islam? For example: 1) Standing alone when his followers were defeated in (the battle of) Hunayn, facing the enemies, saying: “I am the Prophet, not lying! I am the son of Abdul Muttalib!” This is an act that can never be issued by a liar! It is only the honest who has reached the highest levels of certainty or a madman who has reached the highest level of madness and irrationality! Muhammad, as we know from his biography and history, cannot be described as insane, reckless or light-minded at all. 2) Also, when his son Abraham died and the sun was eclipsed and people thought that it was eclipsed in sorrow over the death of Abraham, it was better for the liar claiming prophecy to seize the opportunity or at least to be silent until he confirms with his silence what people thought of the solar eclipse for the death of his son, but contrary to all this, he came out to them saying: “The sun and the moon are two of the signs of God that are not eclipsed for anyone's death or life!” What is the explanation for this strange behavior? 3) Also in the prediction of the unseen that you find in the near prophecy which mentions the time, as in the predominance of the Romans over the Persians (in a few years), but in the distant prophecy it does not mention the date as in the rise of the hour, while the liar will do the opposite. He wouldn’t involve himself in giving a date for the occurrence of the near prophecy, but rather escape from it when necessary. Whereas he can easily give an accurate date for the distant prophecy that will occur after his death because it will not harm him at the time. Why did Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) behave in this way? 4) These things and others like them in the biography of Muhammad must come out with a coherent interpretation, i.e. there is no contradiction! It is not correct to adopt a theory where all the facts, events, actions and words are unexplainable. But it must have the full and undiminished explanatory ability. If you say that he is a liar, for example, you must be able to interpret all his words and actions in the light of this interpretation. 5) It means, for example, in the hadith: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) never ate at a low table or from a small bowl, and that thin bread was not baked for him. Does this seem like a person who seeks the world and its goods or vice versa? 6) He slept on mats until it affected his side, and when the companions offered him another mattress, he refused, and when a woman from the Ansar sent him a mattress stuffed with wool, he ordered Aisha to return it to her. 7) And he used to stand at night until his feet were swollen from the length of the standing. How do these behaviors come from a person who seeks the world or has worldly goals? 8) They offered him money, prestige, women and power so that he would let the prophecy and the message while he was in Mecca weak and with few followers, but he declined and refused until it was reported that he said “If they put the sun on my right and the moon on my left, to leave this matter, I would not leave it!” 9) He endured insults for the sake of his cause and his message that many people cannot bear. Like when they threw the abdominal parts of a slaughtered she-camel on his back while praying at the Kaaba, and he was even chased by children with stones until blood flowed from his feet in Ta’if. And he is honorable among his people and has an impeccable reputation and has merchandise which enriches him for life, so what threw him in these difficulties? And what makes him accept these insults? He gave me a coherent explanatory theory cognitively, this is what is needed. A theory, capable of explaining all these words, deeds and facts. In experimental science, when observing a set of observations, scientists compete to explain them and develop appropriate theories that explain them and explain why they occurred in this way. Here in this regard, we hope to follow the same scientific path, collect all words, deeds and events and then present the correct theory capable of interpreting and explaining them without cost or intransigence. 10) What is the interpretation of what happened from the contemporary Arabs to the Prophet (peace be upon him) when he challenged them with the Quran, so they were unable to meet the challenge and resorted to fighting and fighting it, and for that they endured the destruction of livers, the captivity of women and the orphanage of children. If these people were able to meet the challenge and refute the Quran, they would not have moved from the easiest solution to the most difficult solution, and they would not have had to war, fight and fight with the sword and endure for this what they cannot bear. What is the explanation for this inability of them and their failure to meet the challenge? If the Quran was a book written by Muhammad and the Arabs could oppose it, why did it not do it, meet the challenge and destroy the myth of Muhammad instead of war, fighting, the destruction of souls and the loss of money? It's really amazing!!",

And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment(151) As for those who believe in Allah and His messengers—accepting all; rejecting none—He will surely give them their rewards. And Allah is All- Forgiving, Most Merciful(152)) ﴾ [An-Nisa’: 150-152] God Almighty sent us messengers to show us the way of good, the way of evil, what is the purpose of life and what is the purpose of our creation.

          "answer": "How did existence emerge from the unnecessary and the nowhere? How did lifelessness come into life? How did dead matter move into living cells? Whereas today, at the top of our technology and giant universities, we cannot create simpler images of life, how do we attribute the emergence of life to the blind dead matter? How can an atheist, through his atheism, defend the extermination of all the people of the earth? The material world knows neither right nor wrong? Atheism assumes that humans are mere animals that came in a chain of evolution of inferior beings! What if a finer object appears? Does he have the right to bring humans into animal cages and use them in his drug trials? The explicit answer from the reality of matter and Darwinism is: Yes What if evolution proves that one human race is superior to another, does the finest have the right to turn the inferior into a used substance, as we deal with evolutionarily inferior insects and animals? The answer to materialistic Darwinism is: Yes The atheist assumes that morality is relative – that is, it bears more than one aspect; for example, honesty may be better than betrayal and betrayal may be better than honesty - and then when he comes up with his suspicions - predetermining that it is absolute -. It can only bear one possibility. Honesty is better than betrayal. Because if morality were relative, suspicion has no meaning, because then he would not be able to decide that there is a violation of an ethical standard. This is an apparent contradiction: is morality relative or absolute? If it were absolute, his atheism would end because this means that morality carries a major existential teleology. The will of Allah and the divine commission, even if it is relative, it means that it is not right for an atheist to come up with suspicion or to understand the existence of suspicion in the first place. How did these amazing physical constants that created the universe appear?",

And don't tell me we are chosen, there is no bigger lie than this lie, did you choose my birth, sex, height, width, color and homeland? Does the sun rise and the moon set by my choice? Do I die by choice? Do I fall into misfortunes by choice and find no solution but crime? Why does God force me to do something and then hold me accountable for it? And if you tell me that I am free and that I have a will next to God's will, would this not be polytheism, and falling into the multiplicity of wills? Then what do you say about the judgment of the environment and the conditions in changing this fate and in the inevitability that historical materialists say? The answer is that the questioner is caught in several fallacies, your actions are known to God in his book, he knows that you will choose this choice, so he wrote it, but it is not written on you under duress, it is estimated in his knowledge only as you estimate with your knowledge that your son will do such and such a mistake and then he actually does it, did you force him or was this an appreciation in knowledge from you and your knowledge was right? As for your statement saying freedom is a lie, saying that you did not choose your birth, color, sex, height and color, and that you cannot move the sun from its place, is another mistake, and this time the reason is that you will imagine freedom in a way other than the way we believers imagine it. You will talk about absolute freedom. Freedom to act in the universe and this belongs to God alone. We do not support this freedom and your Lord creates what He wants and chooses what is good for them because God is the one who creates what He wants and chooses. And God will not hold you accountable for your tallness, or reproach you for your height. And He will not punish you because you did not stop the sun in its orbit. The things that God ordered you to do are the ones that He will hold you accountable for. You are free to do as you wish in these matters, and these are the limits in which we speak about. You are free to prevent your lust, resist yourself, kill your evil intentions and encourage your tendencies to good. You can be generous or be stingy, and you can be honest or lie. And you can prevent your hand from forbidden money and your sight from the unlawful figures of others. And you can hold your tongue from backbiting and gossiping. In these matters we are free and this is only what God holds us accountable for.",

He has made it our responsibility to use the abilities He has given us to acknowledge Him. This means that only those who are sincere, humble and reflect deeply will recognise and believe in Him. We (God) will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth.\" Quran 41:53 God provides signs of His existence – both through His natural creation and through revelation. God calls on us to acknowledge Him through His signs and has made it our responsibility to ponder and reflect in order to recognise Him. Some people are receptive to these signs and see God's work all around them, while others dismiss everything as random and meaningless. God has placed in every person, a natural inclination to believe, but this innate predisposition to believe can either be nurtured or suppressed. Importantly, God guides people who are sincere and willing to receive guidance. In other words, those who do not want to believe in God will not be guided. God says, \"God guides Himself whoever turns to Him.\" Quran 13:27 This requires objectivity and an unbiased attitude to the possibility of God's existence, which can be quite confronting and humbling for some people, but without this genuine openness and willingness, no amount of information can make someone believe. In fact, God warns us that those who approach His signs from a position of pride and arrogance will only find justification for their disbelief.",

Rather, we have a higher purpose – to acknowledge and worship God alone, so that we live upon the guidance of our Creator. - This guidance enables us to live a contented and successful life in all aspects. It is part of God’s infinite wisdom that He created us and gave us the opportunity to know Him and to experience our lives and make our own choices. - Islam is a complete and practical way of life that teaches Muslims to be balanced, decent and contributing members of society. - The concept of worship in Islam does not only include praying and supplicating to God. It is a broad definition that includes any action that God is pleased with. Some examples include: Earning an honest living Opposing oppression Taking care of orphans Looking after the environment Having patience & humility Benefiting the community Respecting parents Standing up for justice Kindness to neighbors Having mindfulness of God Providing for one’s family Speaking the truth Acts of worship require the sincere intention to please God and must be performed correctly according to Islamic guidelines.

Three reasons are briefly mentioned below.",

The word Islam means total submission and obedience to God. a single God who has neither partners nor sons. That is why Islam is not a new religion. It is, in essence, the same message and guidance that Allah revealed to all prophets in its comprehensive, complete, and final form. The religion of Islam is based on principles of justice, peace, tolerance, and mercy towards all our brothers in humanity. Muslims have a *direct connection* with their Creator. There is no intermediary, such as praying to or through others, in worshiping God. And this is what makes Islam so special and unique. And * true happiness * is in only found in *worshiping our creator*. as it is the right of the Creator to be worshipped alone and the right of the human being to have direct connection with His Creator. You will find out that most of the teachings of Islam are moral teachings and ethical instructions that will make our world a better place, like don't kill, don't steal, be good to others, respect your parents, speak the truth, don't cheat, be honest, respect your husband or wife, etc.",

All prophets came with one unified message: to worship Allah alone, without any partners or intermediaries. Islam, at its core, is the same monotheistic faith preached by prophets from Adam to Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all). Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) was neither Jewish nor Christian but a true Muslim who submitted entirely to Allah, as the Quran states: \"Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allāh]. And he was not of the polytheists.\" (Quran 3:67). Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) and his disciples were also Muslims. The disciples said, as mentioned in the Quran: \"The disciples said, 'We are supporters for Allah. We have believed in Allah and testify that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].\" (Quran 3:52). Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) did not bring a new religion but came to complete the message carried by previous prophets and to guide humanity back to the pure path after distortions had entered previous scriptures. Islam is the final, complete, and preserved version of God’s religion, emphasizing justice, mercy, and absolute monotheism.",

          "question": "Why is there multiplicity in religions?",
          "answer": "Humanity began as one nation following one religion, with Allah sending messengers with a single unified message: the call to monotheism and the worship of Allah alone, without partners. This message remained consistent across all times and places, emphasizing belief in Allah and adherence to His commands. However, the laws (Shari’ah) brought by the prophets varied according to the needs and circumstances of each era and community. These differences in laws were a mercy from Allah, ensuring they suited the nature and context of each nation, but they never altered the core message of monotheism and submission to Allah. Over time, distortions crept into these divine laws and scriptures. Some people rejected the truth and insisted on denial even after clear evidence was presented to them. Others tampered with the scriptures, adding or removing content or interpreting them in ways that served their personal interests. Some even went as far as mistreating or killing the prophets. Allah says: \"And indeed, there is among them a party who alter the Scripture with their tongues so you may think it is from the Scripture, but it is not from the Scripture. And they say, \"This is from Allāh,\" but it is not from Allāh. And they speak untruth about Allāh while they know.\" (Quran 3:78). As a result of these distortions and deviations, sects and differing ideologies emerged. However, the religion that Allah has always chosen for humanity has remained one: Islam, which means complete submission to Allah. Allah says: \"And whoever desires other than Islām as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers\" (Quran 3:85).",

          "answer": "Who is Allah? 3- Who is Allah? Understanding God in Islam Allah in Islam is the One, the Absolute, the Perfect in His attributes, and eternal in His existence, unlike anything else. In Arabic, we call God \"Allah,\" a term used by Arabic speakers of all faiths, including Christians and Jews, to refer to the Almighty. All agree that Allah is not a trinity. Allah is the Greatest Creator, who brought you into existence from nothing, cared for you in your mother's womb, and granted you intellect, hearing, and sight. He created the heavens and the earth, the moon and the sun, and everything in the universe. Islam calls for the worship of Allah alone, without any intermediary. The relationship with Allah is direct; anyone can communicate with their Creator without needing any other party. Allah says: “And when My servants ask you, [O Muḥammad], concerning Me - indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me.” (Quran 2:186) Allah is the Most Merciful and Forgiving. He forgives the sins of those who sincerely repent and always offers a chance for people to return to Him, no matter their mistakes. Allah says: \"Say, \"O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allāh.'” (Quran 39:53) Allah is perfect in all His attributes. He does not eat, drink, or sleep. He has no children, parents, or partners. He alone deserves worship and submission. Allah knows what is hidden in hearts, manages all matters with wisdom, and everything He decrees for His servants is ultimately good, even if they do not comprehend it. Allah says: \" ِAnd they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills.\" (Quran 2:255). Belief in Allah brings peace and tranquility to the heart, strengthens trust in His wisdom, and ensures confidence in His absolute justice.",

          "question": "Why does God punish people?",
          "answer": "To answer this question, we need to look at the concept of punishment from a rational and realistic perspective. Punishment is an essential part of establishing justice, whether in our daily lives or on a divine level. Human logic dictates that every fair system must include rewards for those who do good and penalties for those who do wrong. In our daily lives, criminal laws punish individuals who commit crimes like theft or murder to protect society and deter others. Similarly, educational institutions reward hard working students with high grades while negligent ones face failure, creating an environment that encourages better performance. If we accept the necessity of punishment and reward to establish justice in our lives, it is even more reasonable that God, as the Creator, holds His creation accountable for their actions. God has granted humans the freedom to choose, and with that freedom comes individual responsibility. If a person decides to deny God’s existence or disobey His commands despite the clarity of evidence and guidance, they bear the consequences of their choices. For instance, if you work for years to save money to secure your future and your family’s, only for someone to steal it in an instant, you would demand justice and punishment for the thief. Here, punishment is not just about revenge but about restoring balance, achieving justice, and preventing others from facing a similar situation. In our daily lives, parents discipline their children when they misbehave, not out of revenge, but to teach them right from wrong. For example, if a child plays with an electrical outlet, a parent might punish them harshly to prevent future harm. Similarly, traffic signals are set up to protect everyone, and if someone runs a red light and causes an accident, they are held accountable for their actions. Punishment here aims to correct the individual and protect others. God is the Most Just and Most Merciful. He sent prophets and revealed scriptures to guide humanity towards the path of righteousness and did not leave people without direction. Divine punishment serves to establish absolute justice and to give every individual what they deserve based on their choices in life. God does not punish until He makes the message and guidance clear to people. Islam emphasizes balancing hope in God’s mercy with fear of His punishment. God grants people time to repent and reform and does not hasten punishment. Divine punishment is not a sign of cruelty but of God’s justice and mercy, helping individuals recognize their responsibilities and giving them a chance to correct their path before it is too late.",

It provides guidance on every aspect of human life. It contains the answers to the mysteries of life and beyond, Where I come from, what happens after death, the purpose of life.

          "question": "Who Wrote the Quran and How Was It Compiled?",
          "answer": "Firstly: Allah Himself guaranteed the preservation of the Quran, as He says in His holy book: \"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Reminder [i.e., the Quran], and indeed, We will be its guardian\" (Quran 15:9). Secondly: Literacy was not widespread among the Arabs during the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). Allah described them as follows: \"It is He who has sent among the unlettered [Arabs] a Messenger from themselves\" (Quran 62:2). The Arabs relied on memorizing the Quran in their hearts, and some of them wrote down verses and chapters on animal skins, thin white stones, and other materials. Thirdly: At the beginning, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) forbade writing anything other than the Quran for a period of time. This was to ensure that the companions focused solely on memorizing and writing the Quran and to prevent any mixing of the Prophet’s words with the words of Allah. This contributed to protecting the Quran from any addition or omission. Fourthly: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) appointed a group of trustworthy and knowledgeable companions to write down the revelation. Among them were Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-As, Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, Zayd ibn Thabit, and others– may Allah be pleased with them all. Fifthly: The Quran was revealed in seven dialects, as mentioned in an authentic hadith narrated by Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him). These dialects represented the eloquent linguistic styles of the Arabs at the time. Sixthly: The Quran remained preserved in the hearts of the companions who memorized it, as well as on the materials on which it was written, until the time of Caliph Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him). After consulting the senior companions, Abu Bakr decided to compile the Quran into a single book to ensure its preservation, especially after many memorizers were martyred in battles. He entrusted this task to Zayd ibn Thabit, who was known for his excellent memorization and meticulousness. Zayd only agreed to write down a verse after two witnesses testified that they had heard it directly from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). This compiled Quran remained with Abu Bakr until his death, then with Umar ibn al- Khattab during his lifetime, and later with Hafsah, the daughter of Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). Seventhly: During the caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), the companions had dispersed across different regions, and variations in recitation arose due to differences in dialects. To prevent disputes, Uthman united the Muslims on a single recitation in the Quraysh dialect, the language in which the Quran was first revealed. He requested Hafsah to send him the copy of the Quran she had, and he tasked Zayd ibn Thabit, Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr, Saeed ibn al-As, and Abdur Rahman ibn Harith ibn Hisham with copying it. He instructed them: \"If you disagree with Zayd ibn Thabit on any point in the Quran, write it in the dialect of Quraysh, for it was revealed in their tongue.\" Once the copies were completed, Uthman returned the original manuscript to Hafsah and sent the new copies to different Islamic provinces. The Quran has remained preserved and transmitted faithfully from generation to generation, both in written form and in the hearts of Muslims, as Allah promised: \"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Reminder [i.e., the Quran], and indeed, We will be its guardian\" (Quran 15:9). And Allah knows best.",

          "question": "Why did Caliph Uthman ibn Affan burn some copies of the Quran?",
          "answer": "The issue of burning the Quranic copies during the caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, has been misunderstood by some, either out of ignorance or deliberate intent. To understand this matter accurately, it is essential to consider the historical context and the reasons behind this decision. The Quran was compiled during the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and was recited to Muslims in various readings that suited the different dialects of the Arab tribes. As Islam expanded and people from non-Arab backgrounds or different dialects embraced the faith, variations in Quranic recitation began to appear. These variations were not due to alterations in the text but resulted from differences in dialects and the inability of some people to comprehend the multiple recitations. These differences started causing disputes, raising concerns that they might lead to doubts about the Quranic text. To preserve the unity of Muslims and safeguard the Quran from any suspicion, Uthman ibn Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, decided to unite the community on one standardized recitation in the Quraysh dialect, the dialect in which the Quran was revealed. Standardized copies of the Quran were produced and distributed to different regions, and any other copies that were written in non-standardized forms were ordered to be burned to prevent confusion. This action was not an alteration or modification of the Quranic text; rather, it was a measure to protect and ensure its uniformity. Allah Almighty has guaranteed the preservation of the Quran, as stated in the verse: \"Indeed, upon Us is its collection [in your heart] and [to make possible] its recitation.\" (Surah Al-Qiyamah: 17). What Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, did was a wise measure, carried out with the consensus of the companions, to ensure the Quran remained unchanged and free of discrepancies. Throughout Islamic history, the Quran has never been altered, thanks to divine preservation and the diligence of the noble companions.",

          "question": "Why did Allah preserve the Quran and allow His earlier books of divine revelation to be changed or lost?",
          "answer": "The answer to this question lies in several key points related to the purpose of divine revelations and the nature of sacred texts. The scriptures revealed before the Quran, such as the Torah and the Gospel, were sent to specific nations and for limited periods of time. Once the mission of the prophet delivering the message was completed or the targeted community ceased to exist, God sent another prophet with a new scripture suited to the new era and circumstances. Therefore, it was not necessary to preserve these scriptures permanently, as their preservation was left as a test for humanity. Unfortunately, people deviated from the truth, altered the content of these scriptures, and added or removed elements to suit their desires, leading to the distortion or loss of the original revelations. In contrast, the Quran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), the final messenger. He was not sent to a specific people or for a limited time but to all of humanity until the end of time. Allah states: \"And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. But most of the people do not know\" (Quran 34:28). Therefore, it was essential for the Quran to be preserved from any distortion or loss so that it could remain a proof for all generations of humanity until the Day of Judgment. The Quran is also the greatest miracle of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the definitive evidence of his prophethood. Preserving the Quran was necessary to ensure the continuation of this miracle and to affirm that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is indeed the final messenger. Over time, false claimants to prophethood have presented their own so-called scriptures, but none of them were preserved in the miraculous way that the Quran has been, nor did they embody its profound message. The Quran is the primary source of Islam and its principles. Through its preservation, the teachings of Islam have been safeguarded in their original purity. Even if people deviate or attempt to make changes, the Quran remains a timeless witness to the truth, allowing humanity to return to it for guidance and correction. Allah says: \"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam\" (Quran 3:19). The loss of the original texts of previous scriptures, such as the Gospel, which disappeared during the persecution of early Christians, or the Torah, which was destroyed during the Babylonian conquest, means that returning to the pure teachings of earlier prophets is impossible except through Islam. Islam is the only religion where the teachings of the prophets have been meticulously preserved through the Quran, which serves as the final and universal message to all of mankind.",

          "question": "Why is abrogation in Quran verses?",
          "answer": "Abrogation in the Quran is part of divine wisdom that aims to achieve human benefit and ease their lives. It is not a contradiction or change in God's knowledge. Human laws themselves change over time to suit the development of societies and their needs; how much more so for God's rulings, which consider the conditions of people across ages? Abrogation in rulings demonstrates God's mercy by gradually guiding His servants according to their capacity for understanding and compliance. Gradual legislation is an effective way to bring about positive change. For example, the prohibition of alcohol was not immediate but occurred in stages, which helped people accept the ruling without societal shock. Abrogation also shows how divine rulings can adapt to changing temporal and social circumstances, ensuring that the new ruling aligns better with the current reality while maintaining fundamental principles. It is also a test of believers' faith and trust in God's wisdom. When Muslims accept abrogation, they demonstrate their devotion to God and readiness to submit to His commands, regardless of changes. Allah says: \"We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?\" (Al-Baqarah: 106). This verse clarifies that abrogation always brings something better or equivalent, indicating that it does not diminish the perfection of legislation but rather enhances its alignment with human benefit. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) explained new rulings to Muslims and clarified their wisdom, as he did in the case of changing the direction of prayer (Qiblah) from Jerusalem to the Kaaba. This change carried both spiritual and political significance, asserting the independence of Muslims from other religions. An example of abrogation in legislation is the change in Qiblah. Muslims initially prayed facing Jerusalem but were later commanded to face the Kaaba. This change highlighted their trust in God's wisdom and established their religious identity. The prohibition of alcohol came in successive stages until it was fully prohibited, reflecting God's mercy in gradually guiding His servants. Similarly, rulings on prisoners of war evolved from killing them to pardoning or ransoming them, demonstrating a moral and humane progression in dealing with enemies. Abrogation often came to ease burdens on Muslims or simplify their obligations. Changes in rulings encouraged greater effort from believers, leading to increased rewards. It also allowed societies to adapt gradually to new laws. Abrogation is not a contradiction or alteration in God's knowledge; rather, it reflects divine wisdom that considers human benefit. It highlights the perfection of divine legislation, its ability to adapt to changing circumstances, and affirms that Islam is a religion of mercy and ease.",

          "question": "Who is Muhammad (peace be upon him)?",
          "answer": "Who is Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, the Prophet of Islam? Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the Seal of the Prophets, sent by Allah as a mercy to all mankind. He was tasked with calling people to the oneness of Allah, teaching humanity, bringing good news, and warning against evil. His message was a continuation of the divine messages sent before him, calling people to worship Allah alone and follow the path of truth. Allah says: \"And We have not sent you, [O Muḥammad], except as a mercy to the worlds.\" (Quran 21:107) Revelation descended upon him at the age of forty, and he spent the remainder of his life calling people to Islam, explaining its teachings, and applying them in practice. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent with the Quran, the final divine book, and Allah made his life a complete model for humanity in faith, morality, and behavior. Allah says: \"There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allāh an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allāh and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allāh often.\" (Quran 33:21) Islam is the final divine message, abrogating previous laws and calling for the worship of Allah alone without intermediaries. Allah says, \"And whoever desires other than Islām as religion-never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\" (Quran 3:85) Worshiping Allah in the manner He has ordained can only be achieved by following the guidance of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a paragon of good character, urging others to embody the best morals. He said, \"The best among you are those with the best character.\" He emphasized kindness in interactions, saying: \"Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should not harm his neighbor; whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should honor his guest; and whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should say what is good or remain silent.\" Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was distinguished by his mercy in all situations. He said: \"Whoever does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.\" When some companions asked him to pray against the disbelievers, he responded, \"I was not sent as one who curses but as a mercy.\" The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a great leader, a loyal husband, a compassionate father, and a truthful friend. His teachings have left a profound impact on humanity, and they continue to guide millions in their daily lives. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was not just a prophet but a practical example embodying all the noble values that Islam calls for, making him a role model for all people across time and place.",

          "question": "How did Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) teach Muslims the importance of tolerance in their daily lives?",
          "answer": "1– Self-accountability: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: 'The wise one is the one who holds himself accountable and works for what is after death, and the incapable one is the one who follows his desires and places false hopes on Allah.' (Narrated by Al-Tirmidhi and authenticated by Al-Albani). This highlights the importance of self-accountability and working for the Hereafter as a part of practicing tolerance with oneself and others. 2– Concealing others' faults: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: 'Whoever conceals the faults of a Muslim, Allah will conceal his faults in this world and the Hereafter.' (Narrated by Muslim). This encourages people to cover others' shortcomings rather than exposing them, fostering an environment of tolerance and mutual respect. 3– Controlling anger: Allah says: 'And who restrain anger and who pardon the people - and Allāh loves the doers of good' (Quran 3:134). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: 'The strong person is not the one who can overpower others in wrestling. Rather, the strong one is the one who controls himself when he is angry.' (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). Tolerance requires the ability to control anger and forgive others. 4– Forgiving others: Allah says: 'And indeed, the Hour is coming; so forgive with gracious forgiveness.' (Quran 15:85). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) urged forgiveness by saying: 'Pardon those who wrong you.' (Narrated by Ahmad with a good chain of narration). 5– Avoiding cursing: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: 'I was not sent as a curser but as a mercy.' (Narrated by Muslim). This encourages avoiding cursing and instead promoting mercy, even towards those who may cause harm. 6– Avoiding suspicion: Allah says: 'O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin.' (Quran 49:12). Tolerance requires refraining from harboring negative assumptions, which can damage relationships and increase hostility. 7– Avoiding arrogance and pride: Allah says: 'And do not turn your cheek [in contempt] toward people and do not walk through the earth exultantly. Indeed, Allāh does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful.' (Quran 31:18). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: 'It is enough evil for a man to belittle his Muslim brother.' (Narrated by Muslim). Humility is a key characteristic of a tolerant person. 8– Avoiding mocking others: Allah says: 'O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them.' (Quran 49:11). Mockery weakens bonds between people and stirs up discord. 9– Exercising patience: Patience is mentioned in over seventy verses in the Quran. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: 'No one is given a gift better and more expansive than patience.' (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). Patience helps in overcoming conflicts and nurturing a spirit of tolerance. Tolerance is not merely a noble virtue but also a means to build a cohesive society filled with love and understanding. The sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the verses of the Quran present a clear model for the virtue of tolerance.",

          "question": "Why should Muhammad be the final Prophet?",
          "answer": "Haven't there been others after him? In John 16:12-13, Jesus says: \"I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth.\" This passage indicates that Jesus promised the coming of a messenger who would complete the message and guide people to the full truth. Muslims believe this refers to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who brought a comprehensive and final message. In Deuteronomy 18:18, God says to Moses: \"I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.\" The text refers to a prophet coming from the \"brothers\" of the Israelites, which means the descendants of Ishmael. This aligns with Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who descended from Ishmael. If Jesus were the last prophet or God Himself, why did He promise the coming of another (John 16:13)? Jesus explicitly stated that his mission was directed only to the Israelites: \"I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" (Matthew 15:24). This demonstrates that his message was not universal, unlike Islam, which came with a message for all of humanity. John Hick, a Christian theologian, argued that the concept of salvation through Christ alone contradicts God's justice and mercy. If God is loving and just, why would salvation be limited to belief in Christ alone, while ignoring millions of people who lived before Christ or in regions where Christianity never reached? This highlights the need for a universal message, such as Islam, which asserts that every individual is held accountable for their actions rather than adherence to a specific creed. Scholars like Bart Ehrman have pointed out that the Bible has undergone alterations over time. This makes it difficult to rely on Biblical texts as evidence that Jesus was the last prophet or that prophethood ended with him. Christian sects such as the Arians and some Eastern Orthodox groups rejected the doctrine of the Trinity and salvation exclusively through Christ. This suggests that the concept of prophethood and finality in Christianity is not universally agreed upon among all denominations. Islam emphasizes that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the final prophet through whom God completed the religion: \"Muḥammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allāh and seal [i.e., last] of the prophets.\" (Surah Al-Ahzab: 40) \"This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islām as religion.\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah: 3) This confirms that Islam came to complete previous messages, not to nullify or replicate them. Unlike previous prophets who were sent to specific communities, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent as a messenger for all of humanity: \"And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner.\" (Surah Saba: 28) God has preserved the Quran from any alteration. \"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an, and indeed, We will be its guardian.\" (Surah Al-Hijr: 9) This is in contrast to previous scriptures, which underwent alterations, making the need for a final, preserved message essential.",

          "question": "Is the Quran authored by Muhammad (peace be upon him) or derived from the Bible?",
          "answer": "We can rely on several logical points supported by evidence from both the Quran and the Bible: 1. Illiteracy of Prophet Muhammad: The Quran affirms the illiteracy of Prophet Muhammad, negating the possibility that he could have written the Quran, as stated in the verse: 'And you did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one with your right hand. Then [i.e., otherwise] the falsifiers would have had [cause for] doubt.' (Al-Ankabut 29:48). 2. The Quranic Challenge to Produce Similar Work: The Quran challenges people to produce a surah like it if they doubt its divine origin, as mentioned in the verse: 'And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down [i.e., the Qur’ān] upon Our Servant [i.e., Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)], then produce a sūrah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses [i.e., supporters] other than Allāh, if you should be truthful.' (Al-Baqarah 2:23). 3. Scientific and Historical Content of the Quran: The Quran contains accurate scientific and historical information unknown at that time, such as details of embryonic development and cosmic realities, indicating that it could not have been authored by someone from the 7th century. 4. Biblical Prophecies About Muhammad: Some scholars refer to prophecies in the Bible they consider to be indications of Prophet Muhammad, such as the Paraclete prophecy in the Gospel of John, which some interpreters believe refers to Muhammad. 5. Doctrinal and Ethical Differences: The Quran corrects and completes the doctrines and teachings of the Bible on topics such as the oneness of God and the stories of the prophets, demonstrating that it is not merely a human composition but divine guidance. 6. Linguistic and Rhetorical Consistency: The Quran is distinguished by its unique rhetorical style and linguistic coherence, surpassing human capabilities, which has challenged the Arabs, known for their language and eloquence. Finally, if the Quran were derived from the Bible, how could the branch surpass the root in every aspect? The Quran offers corrections and additions in doctrinal, ethical, scientific, and linguistic areas, suggesting that it is not merely a repetition of previous contents but an independent revelation that complements and corrects earlier information according to a precise divine plan. These aspects in which the Quran excels affirm that it is not a human work based on previous sources but a divine revelation intended to be an eternal message for humanity.",

          "question": "Are there any miracles for the Prophet Muhammad?",
          "answer": "Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was granted many miracles that confirm the truth of his prophethood. Some are mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah, while others are historically documented and witnessed by his contemporaries. One notable miracle is the protection of the Prophet from assassination attempts, such as the incident when Quraysh planned to kill him while he was sleeping. However, Allah saved him by blinding their vision as he passed among them, as mentioned in the verse: \"And We have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them, so they do not see\" (Surah Yasin: 9). Another miracle was the multiplication of food and water during critical times, such as the siege of Khaybar and the Battle of Tabuk, where the Prophet blessed small amounts of food and water, making them sufficient for large numbers of people. He also foretold future events, such as the conquest of Mecca and the defeat of the Persians, followed by the victory of the Romans, which was fulfilled as stated in the verse: \"The Romans have been defeated In the nearest land But they, after their defeat, will overcome\" (Surah Ar-Rum: 2-3). The Prophet healed the sick through his prayers or by placing his blessed hand on them, as in the case of Qatadah ibn al-Nu'man during the Battle of Uhud. The conversion of his fiercest enemies, such as Umar ibn al-Khattab and Khalid ibn al- Walid, demonstrates his profound moral and spiritual influence. History also records the miracle of the splitting of the moon, mentioned in the Quran and witnessed by many at the time. The Quran itself is the greatest miracle of the Prophet, as it challenged humanity to produce anything like it, but none could. Allah says: \"Say, 'If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants.'\" (Surah Al-Isra: 88). The Quran is unique in its eloquence, legislation, prophecies, and alignment with modern science. The spread of Islam and its establishment of social justice serve as further evidence of the truth of the Prophet's message.",

          "question": "Do Muslims pray for Muhammad and the meaning of pray on him?",
          "answer": "We must understand that sending blessings upon the Prophet is not just a fleeting prayer, but a manifestation of respect and appreciation for the Prophet (peace be upon him) by enhancing his spiritual status in Islam. Firstly, Allah, the Almighty, commanded the believers to send blessings upon the Prophet in the Quran, saying: \"Indeed, Allāh confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels [ask Him to do so]. O you who have believed, ask [Allāh to confer] blessing upon him and ask [Allāh to grant him] peace\" [Al-Ahzab: 56]. Here, prayer does not only mean supplication, but represents a state of appreciation and honor for the Prophet (peace be upon him), as \"prayer\" from Allah means mercy, from the angels it means asking for forgiveness, and from the believers it means asking for blessings and respect. Secondly, in Islam, sending blessings upon the Prophet is not just a religious ritual, but also a means of increasing faith and connection with Allah and His Messenger. If Allah commands the believers to send blessings upon the Prophet, this indicates the importance of this act in strengthening the believer’s relationship with the Prophet (peace be upon him), who is the best of creation and the messenger through whom the divine message was delivered. From a rational perspective, sending blessings upon the Prophet is a constant reminder to Muslims that they need to connect with the prophetic heritage and follow his teachings in all aspects of their lives. It serves as an invitation to correct the believer's behavior and make the teachings of the Prophet (peace be upon him) central to understanding and guiding life.",

          "question": "Why did Prophet Muhammad marry Aisha when she was young?",
          "answer": "The marriage of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, to Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, is a topic that is sometimes raised with the intent of casting doubt. However, when viewed through the lens of reason, logic, and historical, social, and religious context, this marriage reveals profound wisdom and was entirely normal by the standards of the time. Let us discuss the matter in detail. In the time of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, marriage at a young age was common and socially acceptable across the world. There were no fixed legal age limits for marriage as we know them today. Instead, puberty and physical and social maturity were the primary criteria for determining readiness for marriage. In other cultures, marriage at young ages was common. In Europe, until the 19th century, marriage at the age of 7 or 10 was legally permitted. In America, the minimum legal age for marriage in Delaware in 1880 was 7 years. In France, the legal minimum age for marriage was 10 years and was later raised to 13. In the Bible, Isaac married Rebekah when she was very young, as mentioned in Genesis 24:59-60. Solomon had numerous wives, including 700 wives and 300 concubines, as stated in 1 Kings 11:3-4. This context highlights that early marriages were not unusual or exceptional but were a part of the cultural norms of societies worldwide. Factors Behind Marriage at This Age:",

          "answer": "The Six fundamentals of faith A. Iman (Faith) means to believe in the heart, to confess by the tongue, and to act with the parts of the body. What are the pillars of Iman (Faith)? The pillars of Iman are six. The Muslim has to believe in: (1) Allah (2) His Angels (3) His Messengers (4) His Books (5) The Last Day (6) Qadar - Divine Preordainment: good or bad. 1-Belief in God Let me tell you about Almighty God, The Greatest, who created you from nothingness and saved you in the womb of your mother, and gave you hearing, sight, mind and heart, and honored you over all other creatures. We believe in the One True God alone without partners. We believe in the same God Who sent Abraham, Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad, peace be upon them all. Almighty God is One,Unique, and Perfect. God has no partners, no equals and no rivals. God is perfect. does not eat, nor drinks nor sleep. God has no father. No mother. No sons or daughters. No wives , no family. God alone is worthy of all worship. He is not like a man. He is not an idol. He is not a Trinity. He is the Most Powerful, who created the entire universe, stars, galaxies, skies, and all living beings and to him belong all the perfect/good attributes. God is able to do all things, and He is the one who gives life and death. God has full authority and power over all things. Obedience to God does not increase His Power, nor does disobedience decrease His power. God is the Most High. There is nothing above or comparable to God. The attributes of God do not resemble that of His creation. No part of God is present in anyone or anything. God is Perfect. God does not have any human limitations, such as resting on the seventh day after He created the universe. God always maintains attributes of perfection and does not do anything to compromise this perfection, such as “becoming a man”, as claimed by other religions. God does not do ungodly acts, so if God became man and took on human attributes, he would, necessarily, no longer be God. God is Almighty. Who overpowers everything, and who can not be overcome. He is unbeatable, and nothing can prevent Him from fulfilling what He wants. Almighty God is the All-Hearing Who responds to the supplication of His servant. He is so near to you. He even knows what's in your heart without saying it. You can talk to Him directly. Nothing in between No pastor No man No mediator It's just you and Him. Direct connection. Almighty God says : And when My servants ask you, [O Muḥammad], concerning Me - indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me, So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided\" Quran(2:186) God says : \"And We have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him, and We are closer[1528] to him than [his] jugular vein\" ( 50:16 ) He is the Most Merciful ، The Most Forgiving. We need this , because all of us make sins and need to repent to our Lord. So when we commit a sin or fall short in our worship to Allah , we repent to him , knowing that he is the Most Merciful , The Most Forgiving. How do we repent? Just ask for forgiveness, and He forgives us. No mediator in between. It's just you and Him. One to one relationship. Allah (Almighty God) says in the Quran : \" Say, \"O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh forgives all sins.[1354] Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\"\"(39:53) The name of God in Islam is “Allah” which means Almighty God. The word Almighty God is a standard translation of the word Allah in the English Bible. But it's still the same in the Arabic Bible till now. The word Allah is used by all Arab speakers from all faiths, including Arab Christians and Arab Jews. 2-Belief in the Prophets God loves us and has mercy on us that's why He sent us prophets (messengers) to show us the straight path. The first one was Adam, then Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and the last prophet Muhammad. God sends prophets (messengers) to teach us how to worship him. And every prophet was sent to a certain group of people. After the prophet dies and people mislead the way God send another prophet. And so on… All of the prophets were continuations of each other and were sent with the same messag , that there is no deity worthy of worship except the One True God, known in Arabic as Allah. Every prophet was the way to God in his time. Abraham and Noah were the way to their people in their time. And so are Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad. 3-Belief in angels The belief in the existence of angels: the true Muslim believes that God created the angels; they are different creations who are in the worship of God always, and they don’t disobey him. 4- Belief in divine books belief in all divine books, there were so many books, God sent it in succession, one after the other so that he updates his messages and keeps it on earth whenever humans modify it or alter it, so from these books are ( Torah, Psalms, Gospel, Quran), and we believe that the Quran is the final book, so it's the only one to be trusted now since it came to correct and show the right path after previous books were altered and modified and mistranslated by People. 5- Belief in predestination The belief in predestination. The true Muslim believes in the timeless knowledge of God. that he knows the past, present, and future, and he knows what will happen in advance before it happens. This is part of his perfection, and we believe that whatever happens to us unwillingly is made for wisdom, and it's part of the test and that we should be patient and succeed in it. 6-Belief in the last day of judgment The belief in the last day of Judgment, that one day this world will come to an end, and God will revive all dead people from the beginning of time right until the end , and he will judge each one of us individually with a fair judgement. According to Islam the only saved people are those who had faith in the one true God alone (without partners), and submitted to his will, by doing his commandments and teachings which are basically morals.",

The shahadah is a simple profession of faith in the One True God, the God of Abraham, and the belief that Muhammad is His prophet and messenger which should be said with conviction in order to convert to Islam.",

          "question": "Why can we not be able to pray except in Arabic, and is it not possible to speak to God except in Arabic?",
          "answer": "Prayer in Arabic is an essential part of unity and collective communication in Islam. If we reflect on the essence of prayer, we find that it is not just a collection of words or phrases to be recited but rather a direct communication with Allah. This prayer is a unified law for all Muslims, regardless of their languages, which strengthens the sense of brotherhood among Muslims around the world. Allah, the Almighty, chose the Arabic language to be the language of the Quran, which is the miraculous word of Allah that cannot be altered or manipulated. Arabic is not just a regular language but a language rich in meanings and structure, allowing one to express precisely the will of Allah. For example, when Allah is described in the Quran as 'Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim' (the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate), these words convey His attributes with the utmost detail and precision, making them perfectly suitable for the Quran. Furthermore, when we look at the concept of prayer in Islam, it involves fixed words that are recited in every prayer, such as Surah Al-Fatiha and the Takbir. These words are an integral part of the worship mentioned in the prophetic tradition. Prayer is conducted in Arabic because it is the language the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) used to communicate with his companions. Therefore, repeating these words in prayer enhances spiritual communication with Allah. While it is permissible to supplicate and talk to Allah in any language outside of prayer, the formal prayer in Islam is performed in Arabic because it is the language chosen by Allah for the Quran and the prophetic tradition. If prayer were conducted in another language, it might lose some of its accuracy and original meanings. Moreover, the Arabic language preserves the purity of the religion and the correctness of worship. The Quran and the rhetorical miracles it contains could be distorted or lost if religious texts were translated incorrectly. Therefore, using Arabic in prayer protects against such distortion and keeps the texts intact.",

          "answer": "The purpose of worship in Islam is to strengthen the connection between a person and their Creator and to cultivate piety (taqwa) in both heart and behavior. Worship is not merely a set of rituals but a means of self-purification and spiritual growth, helping individuals to recognize God's presence and observe His guidance in all actions and words. When a Muslim performs prayers, fasting, charity, or any other act of worship, the aim is to remind themselves of God's existence and their responsibilities as His servant. Worship enhances one's awareness of God, making them more receptive to His blessings and grace in this world and the Hereafter. It also refines morals, encouraging justice and kindness in dealing with others. Thus, worship in Islam is not only a path to drawing closer to God but also a means of achieving a balanced life built on inner and outer peace.",

          "answer": "The word \"Muslim\" means one who submits to the will of God. This is done by declaring that \"there is no god except one God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God.\" In a broader sense, anyone who willingly submits to the will of God is a Muslim. Thus, all the prophets preceding the prophet Muhammad are considered Muslims. The Quran specifically mentions Abraham, who lived long before Moses and Christ that, \"he was not a Jew or a Christian but a Muslim,\" because he had submitted to the will of God. Thus there are Muslims who are not submitting at all to the will of God, and there are Muslims who are doing their best to live an Islamic life. One cannot judge Islam by looking at those individuals who have a Muslim name but in their actions, they are not living or behaving as Muslims. The extent of being a Muslim can be according to the degree to which one is submitting to the will of God, in his beliefs and his actions.",

This makes a person Muslim. But it should be said in Arabic. Next a person takes a shower is recommendable. Then what? After a person becomes Muslim, s/he is taught about prayers, fasting, alms to the poor, and pilgrimage. These are the pillars of Islam. Then what? Muslims are brothers and sisters. A Muslim should love for his brother or sister, what s/he loves himself/herself. Allah's wealth does not run out and Allah can provide for us all. We pray for each other, and love each other, and love for our brothers and sisters, what we love for ourselves.",

As He says: \"So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it,And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it\". (Surah Al-Zalzalah: 7-8) The good deeds performed by non-Muslims are rewarded in this world. Allah may grant them blessings in their lives, facilitate their success, or relieve them of hardships. As for Muslims, they are rewarded for their good deeds in both this world and the Hereafter because their faith in Allah and their devotion make their actions accepted as pure worship intended for the eternal reward of the Hereafter. Ultimately, the final judgment rests with Allah Almighty. He alone knows what lies in people's hearts and is the most just in His rulings among His servants.",

          "question": "What is the wisdom behind the legislation of stoning in Islam?",
          "answer": "The punishment of stoning is not exclusive to Islam; it has deep roots in other religions, particularly Judaism and Christianity. In the Torah, there are texts that prescribe stoning as a punishment, such as: \"If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death\" (Leviticus 20:10). Similarly, in Deuteronomy, it states: \"If a virgin is pledged to be married, and another man finds her in the city and sleeps with her, you shall take both of them to the gate of the town and stone them to death\" (Deuteronomy 22:23- 24). The Torah does not limit stoning to adultery but also includes other offenses, such as: \"Anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord is to be put to death. The entire assembly must stone them\" (Leviticus 24:16), and the punishment for disobedient sons: \"Then all the men of his town are to stone him to death\" (Deuteronomy 21:21). In Christianity, the New Testament shows how Jesus handled the issue of stoning with wisdom, as seen in the story of the adulterous woman (John 8:7). When the Jews wanted to stone her, Jesus said: \"Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\" He did not reject the punishment but used the situation to teach repentance and mercy. In ancient cultures, such as Babylonian law, the punishment for adultery included drowning or death. Among the Greeks, stoning was mentioned as a method of cleansing sin in the legend of Oedipus. Some Christian scholars have noted that the strict laws of the Old Testament aimed to protect society from moral decay, and stoning was seen as a means of deterrence. In Islam, the punishment of stoning is not an absolute rule but is applied under very strict conditions. It requires the testimony of four trustworthy witnesses who clearly saw the act, making its application nearly impossible except in very rare cases. The purpose of the punishment is to protect society from moral corruption, as adultery is considered a grave offense that impacts the family and community. Islam also emphasizes repentance and encourages the concealment of sins, as the Prophet Muhammad said: \"Avoid implementing the legal punishments as much as you can. If there is any way out for the accused, let them go\" (Abu Dawood). Stoning in Islam is not a new invention but an extension of a punishment found in previous religious laws, with strict conditions that limit its application to very specific circumstances.",

          "question": "Is Islam Intolerant of Other Religious Minorities?",
          "answer": "Islam recognizes the rights of religious minorities and ensures their protection and care within the framework of an Islamic state. The Quran emphasizes tolerance and justice toward those who do not oppose Islam, as Allah says: \"Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes—from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.\" (Surah Al-Mumtahanah: 8). The Quran also declares: \"There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah: 256). Islam guarantees the protection of religious minorities and their places of worship, such as churches and synagogues. For example, when Caliph Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) entered Jerusalem in 634 CE, he granted safety to all inhabitants and respected their freedom of worship. He even refused to pray inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre out of respect for its status as a Christian place of worship. To protect minorities, Islam imposed the jizya, a symbolic tax in exchange for protection and exemption from military service, without forcing non- Muslims to change their religion. Islamic history is rich with examples of peaceful coexistence with religious minorities. During the Golden Age of Al-Andalus, Jews and Christians flourished under Islamic rule. Jews, in particular, enjoyed security and played significant roles in cultural and political life, while they faced persecution in other parts of Europe. Similarly, in other parts of the Islamic world, non-Muslims were granted the right to establish their own courts and apply their family laws. While Islam has a long history of protecting minorities, Muslims have not always been afforded the same tolerance in other societies. During the Spanish Inquisition, Muslims and Jews faced forced conversions and severe persecution. During the Crusades, Muslims faced massacres. In modern times, Muslim minorities continue to face discrimination and oppression in places like Bosnia and India. Islam calls for justice, coexistence, and respect toward religious minorities. Islamic history and Quranic teachings provide clear examples of these humanitarian values in practice.",

One of the highest levels of Jihad is to stand up to a tyrant and speak a word of truth. Control of The self from wrongdoings is also a great Jihad. One of the forms of Jihad is to take up arms in defense of Islam or a Muslim country when Islam is attacked. This kind of Jihad has to be declared by the religious leadership or by a Muslim head of state who is following the Quran and Sunnah.",

It was constructed of stone on the site that was the first place of worship established by Prophet Adam. The Kaabah is not merely a building; it is a symbol of the unity of Muslims worldwide, as they face it in their daily prayers. When Allah commanded Prophet Abraham to invite people to perform pilgrimage to it, his call was in obedience to Allah's divine order. Today, as Muslims gather for Hajj or Umrah, they chant, \"Here I am, O Allah, here I am,\" affirming their response to this divine invitation and continuing the message of monotheism.",

          "question": "Do Muslims worship the Kaaba and the Black Stone?",
          "answer": "Muslims do not worship the Kaaba or the Black Stone; they worship Allah alone. The Kaaba is the Qibla, meaning the direction Muslims face during their prayers, as commanded by Allah in the Quran: \"So turn your face [i.e., yourself] toward al- Masjid al-Ḥarām.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah: 144). This direction unites Muslims in their prayers toward a single direction, but they bow and worship Allah alone. Islam promotes unity among Muslims. Without a designated Qibla, some might pray facing north while others face south. To unite Muslims in their worship of the One True God, Allah made the Kaaba the Qibla. Muslims in the west of the Kaaba face east, while those in the east face west. Muslims were the first to draw world maps, placing the south at the top and the north at the bottom, with the Kaaba at the center. Later, Western cartographers flipped the orientation, but the Kaaba remains at the world's center. When Muslims circumambulate around the Kaaba, it symbolizes their worship of Allah alone. Just as every circle has a single center, Allah is the only center of worship, with no partner or equal. Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said about the Black Stone: \"I know that you are a stone that can neither harm nor benefit. Had I not seen the Prophet (peace be upon him) kiss you, I would not have kissed you.\" (Sahih Bukhari). This statement shows that the Black Stone is symbolic and holds no intrinsic power, and Muslims do not worship or attribute holiness to it. During the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), Bilal ibn Rabah stood on the Kaaba to call for prayer. If Muslims worshipped the Kaaba, would they stand on it? This demonstrates that the Kaaba is not worshipped but serves as a unifying Qibla. The Bible contains clear references to the Kaaba and the Black Stone: In Isaiah 56:7, \"For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.\" This aligns with the Kaaba being a place of prayer for all Muslims. In Psalm 84:6: \"Passing through the valley of Baca, they make it a spring.\" Baca refers to Mecca, and the Kaaba is the house mentioned, near the Zamzam well In Genesis 28:10-22, Jacob set up a Black Stone and called it the \"House of God.\" In Genesis 35:1-3, God reminded Jacob of the stone he had set as the House of God. In Matthew 21:42-43: Jesus confirmed the stone set as the House of God. These references show that the use of a stone as a symbolic house of worship existed in previous scriptures, aligning with the Black Stone's role in Islam. The Book of Genesis mentions Hagar and the Zamzam well, where the angel found her near a spring of water in the wilderness.

          "question": "Why is Pork Forbidden in Islam?",
          "answer": "The prohibition of pork in Islam has religious, environmental, and health dimensions that highlight the wisdom behind this legislation. Islam explicitly forbids the consumption of pork, as stated in the Quran: 'Prohibited to you are dead animals, [241] blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allāh.' (Al-Ma'idah 5:3). This prohibition is not new; it is a continuation of the teachings of previous divine revelations. The Torah (the holy book of Jews and Christians) also states: 'And the swine, though he divides the hoof and is cloven-footed, yet he does not chew the cud; he is unclean to you. Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcass you shall not touch; they are unclean to you.' (Leviticus 11:7-8). Similarly, in Deuteronomy: 'And the swine, because it divides the hoof yet does not chew the cud, it is unclean to you; you shall not eat their flesh nor touch their dead carcasses.' (Deuteronomy 14:8). This indicates that the prohibition of pork is shared between Islam and other divine messages, reinforcing the idea that it is part of divine teachings for human well-being. Pigs play a specific role in the ecosystem as natural scavengers, feeding on filth and waste, making them carriers of diseases. Even in modern environments where pigs are raised in clean conditions, their biological nature remains unchanged. This makes it challenging to ensure they are free from health risks associated with their dietary habits. Research has established a strong connection between pork consumption and several diseases, including parasitic worms, such as the pork tapeworm (Taenia Solium), which can cause significant damage to vital organs if it reaches the brain, heart, or liver. Pork contains high levels of unhealthy fats that increase the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure. While it is believed that cooking pork thoroughly kills parasites, studies have shown that some parasitic eggs, such as Trichiura Trichuris, can survive even after cooking. The prohibition of pork in Islam is not merely a matter of religious devotion but part of a legislative system aimed at protecting humans spiritually, physically, and environmentally. The wisdom behind this prohibition becomes clearer when considering the health and natural aspects of pigs, reflecting divine care for human well-being.",

          "question": "Why do Muslims sacrifice animals on Eid al-Adha?",
          "answer": "The sacrifice of animals during Eid al-Adha is a religious ritual that carries deep symbolic and spiritual meanings, along with social and humanitarian benefits. It is linked to the story of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and his son Ismail, where Ibrahim saw in a dream that Allah commanded him to sacrifice his son. In complete obedience and submission, he was prepared to carry out the command, but Allah stopped him and sent a ram to be sacrificed instead. This story embodies the ultimate act of obedience and the willingness to sacrifice what is dear for the sake of Allah. The purpose of the sacrifice is not the offering of meat or blood but the piety and devotion of hearts, as Allah says: \"Their meat will not reach Allāh, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you.\" (Quran 22:37). Islam instructs that the meat of the sacrifice should be distributed among family, relatives, and the needy, fostering social solidarity and providing the less fortunate with access to meat, which they might otherwise not afford. Through this ritual, Muslims learn to give up what is valuable for the sake of Allah and to help others, instilling values of selflessness and humility. The concept of sacrifice is not unique to Islam; it also exists in previous religions. For example, it is mentioned in the Torah: \"You shall slaughter the ram, take its blood, and splash it on all sides of the altar. Then you shall cut the ram into pieces and burn it on the altar as a burnt offering to the Lord, a pleasing aroma\" (Exodus 29:16-18). This demonstrates that sacrifices were also a means of expressing gratitude and obedience to God in earlier laws. The sacrifice during Eid al-Adha symbolizes complete obedience to Allah, teaches the values of selflessness and generosity, and provides an opportunity to enhance social solidarity. Islam makes this ritual a chance to elevate piety, revive moral values, and offer support to the needy, combining personal worship with communal cooperation.",

          "question": "How do Muslims treat the elderly?",
          "answer": "In Islam, caring for the elderly, especially one’s parents, is considered a great honor and a religious duty. Serving parents is viewed as a sacred obligation, no less important than acts of worship like prayer. Caring for them in their old age is an expression of gratitude for the sacrifices and efforts they made during one’s childhood. Raising and caring for parents is not seen as a burden but as a blessing and mercy from Allah. Mothers, in particular, hold a special status; when the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was asked, \"Who is most deserving of my good company?\" He replied, \"Your mother.\" He was asked, \"Then who?\" He said, \"Your mother.\" He was asked again, \"Then who?\" He said, \"Your mother.\" Then he said, \"Your father.\" When parents reach old age, Islam encourages children to treat them gently and with utmost respect, showing patience and mercy. The Quran provides clear guidance on this matter, as Allah says: \"And your Lord has decreed that you worship not except Him, and to parents, good treatment. Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], \"uff,\" and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word.And lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say, \"My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small\" (Quran 17:23-24). In Islamic societies, nursing homes for the elderly are rare, as living with and serving parents is a fundamental family value. This care is not just a social obligation but a form of worship through which Muslims seek Allah’s pleasure, earning His blessings both in this world and the hereafter.",

Allah says: \"Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women...\" (Al-Ahzab: 35). This means that women, like men, are equal in faith, righteous deeds, and their reward from God, without any discrimination. However, Islam assigns different roles for men and women in society based on their natural dispositions. It gives men the role of providing for and taking care of the family. This is not a privilege but a responsibility. Allah says: \"Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means...\" (An- Nisa: 34). This role is not about superiority but about fulfilling duties. Men are tasked with providing and ensuring financial stability for the family, while women have a significant role in nurturing and raising the next generation. Women’s Rights in Islam:",

          "question": "Does Islam oppress women?",
          "answer": "Islam honors women and grants them rights that were unparalleled in any ancient civilization or culture. At a time when other societies regarded women as inferior or as property to be bought and sold, Islam established equality between men and women in dignity, rights, and responsibilities. Allah says: \"And their Lord responded to them, 'Never will I allow to be lost the work of [any] worker among you, whether male or female; you are of one another.'\" (Quran 3:195). Islam abolished horrific practices like female infanticide, which was prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia, as Allah revealed: \"And when the girl [who was] buried alive is asked For what sin she was killed.” (Quran 81:8-9). Women in Islam have the right to own and manage their property, whether before or after marriage, and retain their family names after marriage. They are not forced into marriage, as their consent is a prerequisite. Islam emphasizes the importance of education for both men and women. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.\" [Ibn Majah]. Islam also grants women the right to seek divorce if they face injustice or cannot continue the marriage. Women may work if they choose, provided it is within ethical boundaries, and they have full control over their earned wealth, spending it as they please. Additionally, Islam obligates men to provide for and protect women, ensuring their safety and dignity. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"The best of you is the one who is best to his family, and I am the best among you to my family.\" [Reported by Al-Tirmidhi]. It is crucial to distinguish between the teachings of Islam and the practices of some Muslims. When oppression occurs, it is often due to cultural traditions or ignorance of Islamic teachings. Islam laid down clear principles to elevate women’s status and protect their rights, and any violation of these principles stems from societal or individual shortcomings. While the Western world began improving women’s rights in the 19th and 20th centuries, Islam granted these rights over 1400 years ago. Rights considered modern in Western societies, such as financial independence, education, and fair treatment, have been fundamental in Islamic teachings since the beginning. In conclusion, Islam elevated the status of women, granting them dignity, rights, and responsibilities at a time when such concepts were unheard of elsewhere. It emphasizes mercy, justice, and kindness in their treatment, as Allah commands: \"And live with them in kindness.\" (Quran 4:19).",

          "question": "Why Does Islam Prohibit Relationships Before Marriage?",
          "answer": "In Islam, the dignity of women is held in the highest regard and is deeply respected. The Arabic word for a woman's womb, \"rahm,\" is derived from one of Allah's names, \"Ar-Rahman\" (The Most Merciful), reflecting the close connection between women and their Creator, the King of kings and the Giver of life. Allah has chosen women to carry and bring life into existence, which is an honor and a noble position. In Islam, women are treated with respect and honor at every stage of their lives. If a woman is in her father's house, raising and providing for her is considered an act of worship for which the father is rewarded by Allah. If she is in her husband's house, treating her kindly and spending time with her is also considered an act of worship for which the husband is rewarded. When Islam was revealed, it granted women their rights and restored their dignity, which had been abused during pre-Islamic times. Unfortunately, this challenge persists in many societies today. One such challenge is the concept of premarital relationships. Some argue that these relationships provide freedom for women and criticize Islam and Muslims for being traditional or conservative. However, when considered rationally and objectively, which scenario is more respectful and dignified for women?",

          "question": "Why does Islam prevent Muslim women from marrying non-Muslim men?",
          "answer": "In Islam, a Muslim man is not permitted to marry a non-Muslim woman unless she is Christian or Jewish. He is not allowed to marry a woman of any other faith. However, a Muslim woman is not allowed to marry a non-Muslim man, even if he is Christian or Jewish. The reason for this is that Islam places great importance on the marital bond between a husband and wife, which must be built on a solid foundation. Allah says in the Quran: \"And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought\" (Al-Rum: 21). When a Muslim man marries a Christian or Jewish woman, Islam commands him to respect her faith. He is not allowed to prevent her from practicing her religious rituals or from attending church or synagogue. This respectful attitude ensures the protection and stability of the family. However, when a Muslim woman marries a non-Muslim man, respect for her religion cannot be guaranteed. A Muslim believes in all prophets and respects Christianity and Judaism, whereas a non-Muslim may not believe in the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This means a Muslim woman cannot be assured of her freedom to practice her religion, and she would have to live with a man who does not respect her faith. For example, a Muslim woman's adherence to her religious obligations could deprive her husband of some of his marital rights, such as abstaining from marital relations during fasting, which a non-Muslim husband may not accept. Additionally, she would not be able to share meals with him while fasting, travel for Hajj or Umrah without his permission, or perform her daily prayers and other voluntary acts of worship on time. Moreover, Islam places the responsibility for raising children on the father. He is the spiritual leader of the household and is responsible for teaching the children about Islam. If a Muslim woman marries a non-Muslim man, he will not be able to teach the children Islamic values or support their commitment to Islamic practices. This could result in children growing up detached from Islamic teachings, weakening both the family and the Muslim community. In other words, the wife’s adherence to her religious practices and her responsibility to educate her children in Islam could lead to conflict with a non-Muslim husband, causing instability in the marriage and family life.",

          "question": "Why is polygamy allowed in Islam?",
          "answer": "Polygamy is often misunderstood and criticized without a true understanding of its context in Islam. It is important to clarify that polygamy is neither a new phenomenon nor exclusive to Islam; it has been practiced historically across cultures and religions, including Judaism and Christianity, where it was allowed and even common. Islam did not invent polygamy but came to regulate it with strict conditions to protect women's rights and ensure justice. Before Islam, men could marry an unlimited number of women without bearing any responsibility toward them. Islam limited this to a maximum of four wives, provided that fairness and equality among them are maintained. Allah says in the Quran: \"Then marry those that please you of [other] women, two, three, or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one.\" (Surah An-Nisa: 3) If a man cannot achieve fairness, he is prohibited from having multiple wives, emphasizing that justice is a fundamental principle in Islamic law. The allowance for polygamy in Islam serves specific social and humanitarian purposes. For instance, it offers a solution for widows, divorcees, and orphans, promotes social solidarity, and addresses societal imbalances, such as a surplus of women compared to men, especially after wars. Islamic history demonstrates how polygamy was a means to provide care and protection to women who might otherwise face neglect or hardship. Critics often ignore the fact that polygamy is not unique to Islam. The Bible itself contains numerous examples of prophets who practiced polygamy, such as Abraham, Jacob, and Solomon. Furthermore, polygamy is not explicitly forbidden in the Bible, which even provides guidelines for fair treatment of multiple wives, as stated in Exodus 21:10: \"If he takes another wife, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing, and marital rights.\" This demonstrates that polygamy was accepted and regulated in earlier religious traditions. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) practiced polygamy not for personal desires but for humanitarian, religious, and political reasons. For the first 25 years of his married life, he was married to only one wife, Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her), and did not marry anyone else until her passing. His subsequent marriages primarily aimed to care for widows, strengthen social bonds, and spread the message of Islam. Most of his wives were widows or divorcees, and each marriage had a specific purpose beyond personal gratification. In the modern era, some criticize polygamy in Islam while ignoring the prevalence of extramarital affairs and infidelity in societies that claim to uphold monogamy. Studies have shown that many women in such relationships lack legal and financial protection, with some preferring the rights and status provided by legitimate second marriages under Islamic law. Islam regulates polygamy with conditions that ensure the protection of all parties involved, contrasting sharply with the unregulated and exploitative practices found elsewhere. Polygamy is not mandatory in Islam. The majority of Muslim men choose to have only one wife, recognizing the challenges of fulfilling the necessary conditions for multiple marriages. Allah has acknowledged the difficulty of achieving perfect fairness in the Quran: \"And you will never be able to be equal [in feeling] between wives, even if you should strive [to do so].\" (Surah An-Nisa: 129) Ultimately, Islam does not encourage polygamy as a means of exploiting women or satisfying desires. Instead, it governs it with wisdom and conditions aimed at addressing social issues, protecting women's rights, and ensuring justice. Criticism of polygamy in Islam often stems from misunderstanding or double standards, especially when compared to the widespread prevalence of unregulated extramarital relationships in societies that claim to reject polygamy.",

          "question": "Why does Islam allow men polygamy and forbid it to women?",
          "answer": "Polyandry (a woman marrying more than one man at the same time) is strictly prohibited in Islamic law and is also rejected by other divine religions. This prohibition is not arbitrary or discriminatory but is based on rational, logical, and religious foundations aimed at protecting the family and society and ensuring their stability. Islam unequivocally prohibits polyandry, as clearly stated in the Quran: \"And [prohibited to you are] married women except those your right hands possess...\" (Surah An-Nisa: 24). This verse explicitly forbids a woman from being married to more than one man at the same time. Islam highly values family structure and places great emphasis on organizing marital relationships to ensure the clarity of children's lineage and the clear division of responsibilities. In Christianity, there are clear references to the exclusivity of the marital relationship between one man and one woman. For example, 1 Corinthians 7:2 states: \"But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.\" This emphasizes that marriage is an exclusive covenant between one man and one woman, leaving no room for polyandry. There are several rational and logical reasons for prohibiting polyandry. First, in cases of polyandry, it becomes practically impossible to determine the biological father of children easily, leading to confusion in lineage. This can have severe psychological and social consequences for the child, as children who are unaware of their father's identity often experience mental health issues and difficulties in forming healthy social relationships. From a physiological and social perspective, men can fulfill their marital duties even if they have more than one wife. In contrast, women with multiple husbands would struggle to meet the demands of multiple marital relationships, especially due to the hormonal and psychological changes associated with their menstrual cycles and other factors. When a woman has multiple sexual partners, the likelihood of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) increases significantly, even if all relationships are within marriage. These diseases could then spread to all husbands. On the other hand, in cases where a man has multiple wives and all relationships are confined to marriage, such risks are minimized. Polyandry disrupts the foundation of family structures, which affects the stability of society as a whole. The family is the basic unit of society, and polyandry complicates the division of roles and responsibilities within this unit, leading to social instability. Women are naturally inclined to form deep emotional bonds with one partner, while men are biologically more predisposed to polygamy. Attempts to alter this natural disposition result in psychological and behavioral imbalances, negatively impacting both genders. The prohibition of polyandry is not a restriction on women but rather a regulation aimed at protecting women and their children from psychological and social chaos. It ensures family and societal stability and reflects divine wisdom designed to achieve justice and harmony between genders.",

          "question": "Why the hijab in Islam?",
          "answer": "The hijab in Islam represents values of modesty, respect, and the preservation of a woman's dignity. It is not merely an attire but part of a comprehensive ethical system aimed at protecting society from moral decay. In Islam, the hijab balances individual rights with societal harmony, emphasizing the respect for women as whole individuals rather than objects of temptation or attraction. Islamic Perspective on Modesty: Islam calls for modesty for both men and women. Allah commands believers to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, as stated in the Quran: \"Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts That is purer for them. Indeed, Allāh is [fully] Aware of what they do And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests...\" (Surah An-Nur: 30-31). The Hijab Is Not a New Concept: What makes the hijab unique in Islam is that it is not an innovation but a continuation of the teachings of previous prophets. All divine religions have called for modesty. In the Bible, there are clear references to covering the head as a sign of respect and modesty. For example: In 1 Corinthians 11:5-6: \"But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head...\" In Genesis 24:65: \"Then she took her veil and covered herself.\" Even Mary, the mother of Jesus—who is a symbol of purity and sanctity in both Christianity and Islam—is always depicted wearing a headscarf in images and statues. The Wisdom Behind the Hijab in Islam: The hijab reflects Islam’s respect for the nature of women and their psychological and social needs. It protects women from unwarranted gazes, granting them a sense of security and privacy. Additionally, it reminds society of the value of women as individuals, not merely their outward appearance. The concept of hijab is not a novel idea introduced by Islam; rather, it continues the divine teachings of previous prophets, organizing them to ensure human rights and dignity. Wearing the hijab symbolizes a woman’s respect for herself, her pride in her religious identity, and her adherence to Allah’s commands, serving as a means of drawing closer to Him.",

          "question": "How to respond to the verse of beating up women in the Quran?",
          "answer": "Islam addresses the verse regarding striking women in the context of organizing family relationships and resolving conflicts in a gradual manner. It begins with admonishment and wise advice as the first step. If the issue persists, the next step is to refrain from sharing the bed as a clear signal that there is a problem that needs resolution. As a final measure, light and symbolic striking is permitted, under strict guidelines, ensuring that it causes no physical or psychological harm. This has been interpreted as using very light tools, like a miswak. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) never struck any of his wives and was a role model in treating women with kindness and respect. He said, \"The best of you are those who are best to their families, and I am the best among you to my family,\" reflecting the ideal approach in dealing with wives. Furthermore, the imperative form used in the verse, \"and strike them,\" in Arabic does not imply obligation but can indicate allowance or permissibility, making this action exceptional rather than a standard practice. Islam came to protect women and uphold their dignity. This verse is not a justification for violence against women; rather, it is part of a system aimed at safeguarding the family and resolving conflicts in peaceful and organized ways. Domestic violence, prevalent in many cultures, has no basis in Islamic teachings. Islam imposes strict limits to protect women from harm. The Prophet (peace be upon him) emphasized that the best men are those who treat their wives well, and he exemplified this in his life.",

          "question": "What is the role of Al-Hoor Al-'Ayn in Paradise, and how does it align with Allah's justice between men and women?",
          "answer": "Men and women have different natures that can be easily observed in daily life. Allah created humans and knows their nature and the consequences of evil. This is why He commanded believers in the Quran not to look at women in an inappropriate way and commanded women to wear modest clothing to protect them from harm and help men lower their gaze. In Islam, engaging in a sexual relationship outside of marriage is considered a major sin punishable by hellfire. Believing men who obey Allah’s commands, do not harm women, and refrain from illicit relationships are rewarded in Paradise with beautiful women (Al-Hoor Al-‘Iyn) as their wives. As for believing women, they are granted beauty far surpassing that of Al-Hoor Al-‘Iyn by seventy times. A believing woman enters Paradise as a reward for her righteous deeds, making her of a higher status than Al-Hoor Al-‘Iyn, who were created solely as a reward for the believers. Allah is the Most Just and Wise. The ultimate goal of every believer, male or female, is to attain Allah’s pleasure and enter Paradise. In Paradise, a person is granted every form of delight that no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined. Allah says: 'We [angels] were your allies in worldly life and [are so] in the Hereafter. And you will have therein whatever your souls desire, and you will have therein whatever you request [or wish] as accommodation from a [Lord who is] Forgiving and Merciful.' (Fussilat 41:31-32). The status of a believing woman in Paradise is far superior to that of Al-Hoor Al-‘Iyn. She enters Paradise as a reward for her righteous deeds and is honored for her piety and commitment. In contrast, Al-Hoor Al-‘Iyn were created in Paradise solely as a reward for believers. There is a significant difference between someone who enters Paradise as a reward for their deeds and someone who was created as a reward for others. The believing woman is a queen and lady in Paradise, while Al-Hoor Al-‘Iyn, no matter how beautiful, are of a lower status than the queen.",

          "question": "What is the wisdom behind circumcision in Islam?",
          "answer": "Circumcision in Islam and the Bible Circumcision is a practice related to religious commitment and is part of the covenant between God and His servants in many religions, including Islam and Christianity. Circumcision in the Bible: In the Bible, circumcision is clearly mentioned as part of the covenant between God and His people. In the Old Testament, it is referred to as a sign of the covenant that God made with Abraham and his descendants. In Genesis 17:9-14, God says to Abraham: \"This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised... Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.\" This verse makes it clear that circumcision was a fundamental sign of the covenant with God and was seen as an essential requirement for maintaining that relationship with God. Circumcision in Islam: In Islam, circumcision is considered a Sunnah of Fitrah (natural practice), representing cleanliness and purification. It is seen as an act of maintaining bodily purity. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) mentioned it in many sayings, encouraging circumcision as part of personal hygiene. A well- known hadith states: \"Five practices are part of the Fitrah: circumcision, shaving the pubic hair, trimming the mustache, cutting the nails, and plucking the armpit hair.\" Why is circumcision practiced in Islam?",

          "answer": "a. Abortion: Islam considers abortion as murder and does not permit it except to save the mother's life. Allah says: 'Do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them.' (Quran 6:151, interpreted alongside 17:31). b. Homosexuality and AIDS: Islam categorically opposes homosexuality and considers it a sin. However, Muslim physicians are advised to care for AIDS patients with compassion just as they would for other patients. c. Euthanasia and Suicide: Islam is opposed to both euthanasia and suicide. Muslims do not believe in heroic measures to prolong the misery of a terminally ill patient. d. Organ transplantation: Islam stresses saving lives. Allah says: 'Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land—it is as if he had slain mankind entirely.' (Quran 5:32). Thus, transplantation in general would be considered permissible in necessity provided a donor consent is available. The sale of the organ is not allowed.",

          "question": "How does Islam address the issue of racism and nationalism?",
          "answer": "\" Islam teaches us that all humans were created from the same origin, clay, which means there is no justification for anyone to consider themselves superior to another. We are all created from the same components, regardless of our cultural or racial differences. In the sight of Allah, superiority is not based on skin color or race but on righteous deeds and piety. The differences in races and cultures in Islam are not a means of division or discrimination but a way for people to know and understand one another. Allah says: \"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allāh is Knowing and Aware.\" (Quran 49:13). This diversity is a blessing from Allah and part of His creative magnificence, as He says: \"And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge.\" (Quran 30:22). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized this principle of equality in his farewell sermon, saying: \"O people, your Lord is One, and your father is one. There is no superiority of an Arab over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab over an Arab, nor of a white over a Black, nor a Black over a white, except by piety. Have I not conveyed the message?\" (Musnad Ahmad). Islam strictly prohibits boasting about one’s race or culture at the expense of others. The Prophet (peace be upon him) warned against tribalism and said, \"He is not one of us who calls for tribalism, or fights for tribalism, or dies for tribalism.\" (Sunan Abu Dawood). Islam rejects all forms of racism and nationalism. It teaches that all people are equal before Allah and that true virtue lies in piety and good deeds, not in racial or cultural affiliations.",

The Qur'an clearly declares the principle of freedom of belief, as Allah says: \"There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion.\" (Qur'an 2:256), meaning that the choice of religion and faith is a personal right safeguarded without coercion. Islam protects human life and property, considering them sacred regardless of religion or ethnicity. Allah says: \"And whoever saves one[260] - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely.\" (Qur'an 5:32), reflecting the importance of preserving human life. Islam upholds the principle of equality among people and encourages cooperation and mutual understanding between nations and communities. Allah says: \"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allāh is the most righteous[1521] of you. Indeed, Allāh is Knowing and Aware.\" (Qur'an 49:13), emphasizing that superiority is not based on lineage or race but on piety and righteous deeds. In an Islamic state, the rights of religious minorities are safeguarded, and their beliefs are respected. Everyone is treated with fairness and equality. Justice is a fundamental principle of governance in Islam, as Allah says: \"Indeed, Allāh orders justice and good conduct and giving [help] to relatives.\" (Qur'an 16:90). Islam not only preserves individual rights but also encourages societal cooperation to achieve collective good, emphasizing mercy and mutual respect in human relationships.",

          "question": "Is Islam Intolerant of Other Religious Minorities?",
          "answer": "Islam recognizes the rights of religious minorities and ensures their protection and care within the framework of an Islamic state. The Quran emphasizes tolerance and justice toward those who do not oppose Islam, as Allah says: \"Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes—from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.\" (Surah Al- Mumtahanah: 8). The Quran also declares: \"There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah: 256). Islam guarantees the protection of religious minorities and their places of worship, such as churches and synagogues. For example, when Caliph Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) entered Jerusalem in 634 CE, he granted safety to all inhabitants and respected their freedom of worship. He even refused to pray inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre out of respect for its status as a Christian place of worship. To protect minorities, Islam imposed the jizya, a symbolic tax in exchange for protection and exemption from military service, without forcing non- Muslims to change their religion. Islamic history is rich with examples of peaceful coexistence with religious minorities. During the Golden Age of Al-Andalus, Jews and Christians flourished under Islamic rule. Jews, in particular, enjoyed security and played significant roles in cultural and political life, while they faced persecution in other parts of Europe. Similarly, in other parts of the Islamic world, non-Muslims were granted the right to establish their own courts and apply their family laws. While Islam has a long history of protecting minorities, Muslims have not always been afforded the same tolerance in other societies. During the Spanish Inquisition, Muslims and Jews faced forced conversions and severe persecution. During the Crusades, Muslims faced massacres. In modern times, Muslim minorities continue to face discrimination and oppression in places like Bosnia and India. Islam calls for justice, coexistence, and respect toward religious minorities. Islamic history and Quranic teachings provide clear examples of these humanitarian values in practice.",

          "question": "Does Islam promote violence and terrorism?",
          "answer": "Islam is a religion of peace and mercy, and it rejects terrorism in all its forms. Killing is considered one of the gravest sins in Islam. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: “The first cases to be adjudicated among people on the Day of Judgment will be those of bloodshed.” The Quran emphasizes fairness and justice, even towards non-Muslims, as it states: “Allāh does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allāh loves those who act justly.” (Quran 60:8). Islam categorically rejects unjust violence and the killing of innocents. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Whoever kills a person who has a treaty with the Muslims shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise” (Reported by Bukhari). The Quran affirms the sanctity of human life, declaring: “whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And Our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors” (Quran 5:32). Since the dawn of Islam, killing women, children, monks, and non-combatants has been prohibited, with strict rules preventing aggression during warfare. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Do not kill an elderly person, a child, or a woman” (Reported by Abu Dawood). Jihad in Islam is not synonymous with terrorism. It refers to the struggle against evil within oneself and society. Jihad includes self-improvement, spreading goodness, resisting oppression, and defending oneself when necessary. It does not involve killing innocents or committing acts of terror. The Quran states: “Fight in the way of Allāh those who fight against you but do not transgress. Indeed, Allāh does not like transgressors. ” (Quran 2:190). Regarding violence in other religious texts, the Bible contains passages that explicitly call for killing, such as: “Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man” (Numbers 31:17-18) and “Kill the old men, the young men and women, the mothers, and the children” (Ezekiel 9:6). These verses show direct orders for violence against vulnerable groups, raising questions about why such texts are overlooked when discussing terrorism. Throughout history, the most horrific mass atrocities were not committed in the name of Islam. For example, Joseph Stalin killed 20 million people, and Mao Zedong killed between 14 to 20 million people. The two World Wars claimed over 70 million lives, and none of the perpetrators were Muslim. Similarly, the Crusades carried out in the name of the Church led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, while the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed hundreds of thousands. As for extremist groups like ISIS and Boko Haram, they do not represent Islam in any way. Their actions directly contradict the clear teachings of Islam, which call for peace and justice. Allah says: “There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion” (Quran 2:256), and “whoever kills a soul unless for a soul[258] or for corruption [done] in the land[259] - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely.” (Quran 5:32). Islam calls for the rejection of violence and condemns terrorism, regardless of the perpetrator’s identity.",

          "question": "Was Islam spread by the sword?",
          "answer": "The Quran clearly states that faith cannot be imposed by force. As Allah says: \"There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion.\" (Quran 2:256). This verse establishes a fundamental principle in Islam, prohibiting any coercion in matters of faith. It is true that Islamic armies carried swords during some conquests, but this was for defensive purposes or to liberate people from oppression, not to force them to embrace Islam. At that time, the sword was the standard weapon for defense and warfare. However, the spread of Islam was not tied to the use of force. Many regions that became predominantly Muslim, such as Indonesia, China, and large parts of Africa, were never reached by Islamic armies. Instead, Islam spread in these areas through trade and peaceful preaching. The claim that Islam spread by the sword can be refuted with a simple comparison. If this claim were true, why have religious minorities in Muslim-majority countries remained on their own faiths? For example, today, approximately 10% of the population in the Arab world are Christians. Additionally, in India, where Muslims ruled for 700 years, the majority of the population remains Hindu, as they were not forcibly converted to Islam. If the spread of a religion is assumed to be through force, we might ask: Did Christianity spread through guns or bombs? Certainly not. Christianity spread through missionary efforts. Similarly, Islam is spreading in the modern world through peaceful preaching. It is currently the fastest-growing religion in the United States, with over 6 million followers, without any military intervention. In conclusion, the spread of Islam was not achieved by the sword but through peaceful means, such as preaching, trade, and ethical interactions with people. Claims to the contrary are inconsistent with historical facts and the true nature of Islam as a religion that promotes peace and freedom.",

          "question": "Who is Jesus in Islam?",
          "answer": "10 Facts About Jesus The Story of Jesus Jesus (peace be upon him) is one of the noble prophets sent by God to guide humanity to the worship of God alone. In Islam, Jesus (peace be upon him) is not considered divine nor the son of God, but rather a messenger, like all other prophets, calling to monotheism. Allah says: \"The Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, was but a messenger of Allāh and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul [created at a command] from Him.\" (Quran, 4:171) The birth of Jesus (peace be upon him) was a miraculous event, as he was born to the Virgin Mary without a father. Allah says: \"And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign\" (Quran, 23:50) Islam rejects the idea of Jesus being divine or the son of God because God does not require children or partners. Allah says: \"The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth\" (Quran, 5:75) \"Indeed, Allāh is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son\" (Quran, 4:171) Jesus (peace be upon him) performed many miracles by God's permission, such as healing the sick, giving sight to the blind, and even bringing the dead back to life. Allah says: \"And I cure the blind [from birth] and the leper, and I give life to the dead - by permission of Allāh.\" (Quran, 3:49) These miracles were a testament to his truthfulness as a prophet and messenger of God. Islam also teaches that Jesus (peace be upon him) was neither crucified nor killed. Instead, Allah saved him and raised him to heaven. Allah says: \"And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it..\" (Quran, 4:157) Jesus (peace be upon him) will return at the end of times to reaffirm the message of monotheism. Jesus (peace be upon him) preached repentance and worship of God alone. Islam reaffirms his pure and original message, which was to call humanity to the worship of the One True God without intermediaries or partners. Allah says: \"[Jesus said], \"And indeed, Allāh is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path\" (Quran, 19:36).",

          "question": "Is Jesus the Son of God?",
          "answer": "The Christian belief that Jesus is the Son of God contradicts several texts in the Bible and logic. Let's examine the evidence showing that Jesus cannot be the Son of God in terms of divinity. The Bible mentions many \"sons of God,\" not just Jesus. For instance, in Exodus 4:22, God says, \"Israel is my firstborn son.\" In Psalm 89:26-27, it says, \"I have chosen David as my firstborn son.\" In Deuteronomy 32:19, God speaks of \"His sons and daughters.\" In 2 Samuel 7:14, He says, \"I will be his Father, and he shall be My son.\" Similarly, angels are called \"sons of God\" in Job 38:7, and the term also refers to righteous people, such as Solomon and David in 2 Samuel 7:13-14. Therefore, the term \"Son of God\" refers to a special relationship or a high status, not divinity. It's noteworthy that Jesus often refers to Himself as the \"Son of Man\" rather than the \"Son of God.\" For example, in Mark's Gospel, the term \"Son of God\" is used zero times, but \"Son of Man\" is used 13 times. In Matthew, \"Son of God\" is used zero times, and \"Son of Man\" appears 30 times. Similarly, in Luke, \"Son of God\" is used zero times, but \"Son of Man\" appears 25 times. When asked directly in Luke 22:70, \"Are you the Son of God?\" Jesus does not confirm but replies, \"You say that I am He.\" This shows that Jesus did not explicitly call Himself the Son of God. In several verses, Jesus shows that He is fully human, not divine. In John 8:40, He says, \"I am a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God.\" In Matthew 26:39, He prays, \"My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.\" Some might argue that Jesus being born without a father makes Him the Son of God, but this logic fails when we consider Adam, who was created without a father or mother. In Quran 3:59, it says, \"Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created him from dust; then He said to him, 'Be,' and he was.\" The Bible also mentions Melchizedek, who had no father, mother, or genealogy, and is said to be \"like the Son of God\" in Hebrews 7:1-3. Does this mean Melchizedek is also divine? This shows that the absence of a father does not equate to divinity. Islam emphasizes that Jesus is a Messenger of God, not the Son of God. He is the Word of God in the flesh, as stated in the Quran. Jesus performed miracles, but these were done by God's permission, not as a result of His own divinity. Thus, the term \"Son of God\" is metaphorical, referring to righteous people and prophets, and does not imply divinity",

          "question": "Is Christ the Lord?",
          "answer": "Jesus admits that he cannot do anything by himself, indicating his dependence on God and denying his divinity. In John 14:28, it states, \"For my Father is greater than I.\" This verse confirms that Jesus is not God, as God cannot be lesser than himself. In Matthew 24:36, Jesus says, \"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\" Jesus's ignorance of the hour is clear proof that he is not all-knowing, a characteristic unique to God. In John 20:17, Jesus refers to God as \"My God,\" which raises the question, if Jesus were God, how could he refer to God as \"My God\"? Additionally, in John 1:18, it is written, \"No one has ever seen God.\" Yet, people saw and touched Jesus, proving he is not God. Jesus clearly acknowledges that he is a human being sent by God in John 8:40: \"But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God.\" Jesus repeatedly refers to himself as the \"Son of Man,\" affirming his humanity, as seen in Mark 2:10: \"But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.\" In Numbers 23:19, it is stated, \"God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should change His mind.\" This directly refutes the divinity of Jesus, who is repeatedly called the \"Son of Man.\" In Malachi 3:6, God says, \"I the Lord do not change.\" If God became human, this would represent a change in His nature, contradicting the immutable nature of God. The Bible teaches that Jesus died in Mark 15:37: \"And Jesus cried out with a loud voice and gave up his spirit,\" yet God is eternal and cannot die, as stated in 1 Timothy 1:17: \"To the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever.\" In Mark 13:32, it says, \"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\" If Jesus does not know the hour, he cannot be all-knowing, a defining characteristic of God. Additionally, in James 1:13, it is written, \"For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone,\" yet the Bible states that Jesus was tempted by Satan: \"Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil\" (Matthew 4:1). Bart Ehrman pointed out that the divinity of Jesus was not originally part of his teachings but rather developed in later centuries. His book \"How Jesus Became God\" explains that the idea of Jesus's divinity was a product of theological evolution over time. John Hick asserted that miracles are not evidence of divinity, as earlier prophets performed great miracles without anyone claiming they were gods. The Arians and other early Christian sects rejected the idea that Jesus was God. They regarded him as a great prophet and messenger of God. In Islam, Jesus is regarded as a servant and messenger of God, as stated in the Quran: \"The Messiah would never disdain to be a servant of Allah\" (Surah An-Nisa: 172). The miracles performed by Jesus, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, were by God’s permission, as stated in Surah Al-Ma'idah: 110: \"And when you brought forth the dead with My permission.\" Islam emphasizes the absolute oneness of God, with no partners or equals, as seen in Surah Aal-E-Imran: 51: \"Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is the straight path.\"",

          "question": "Is the doctrine of the Trinity explicitly mentioned in the Bible?",
          "answer": "The doctrine of the Trinity, which claims that God consists of three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, contradicts both clear biblical texts and logic. The Bible explicitly states that God is one, as mentioned in Isaiah: \"I am the first, and I am the last; apart from me there is no God.\" (Isaiah 44:6), and confirms: \"I am the Lord; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another.\" (Isaiah 42:8). These verses refute the concept of the Trinity and affirm the monotheism advocated by Islam: \"Say, He is Allah, [Who is] One.\" (Al-Ikhlas: 1). The Bible also asserts that God is not a human being, as stated in Numbers: \"God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind.\" (Numbers 23:19), while Jesus himself says: \"I am a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God.\" (John 8:40). This distinction between God and Jesus is further supported by the Bible's declaration: \"I, the Lord, do not change.\" (Malachi 3:6). If God does not change, how could He become a human? This contradicts the idea of divine incarnation. The Bible describes God as a spirit, as in John: \"God is spirit.\" (John 4:24), whereas Jesus said: \"A spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" (Luke 24:39). This clearly demonstrates that Jesus is not a spirit and therefore cannot be part of God. The only verse that explicitly supports the Trinity: \"For there are three that bear record in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.\" (1 John 5:7) has been proven to be a later addition and is absent in earlier manuscripts. In Matthew, Jesus said: \"No one knows the Son except the Father.\" (Matthew 11:27), which excludes the Holy Spirit's knowledge of the Father. Furthermore, in Mark: \"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\" (Mark 13:32), which raises the question: How can the Holy Spirit be God if it is unaware of the hour? Passages often cited to support the Trinity, such as Jesus' baptism in Matthew: \"As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.\" (Matthew 3:16), do not prove the Trinity. The presence of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit simultaneously does not imply they are one. Similarly, the plural form is used in Genesis: \"Then God said, ‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness.’\" (Genesis 1:26) is a form of reverential language, not evidence of multiplicity. If Jesus were God, why did he say: \"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\" (Mark 13:32)? And if he was sent only to the Israelites, as he said: \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\" (Matthew 15:24), how can he be God for all humanity? These questions, along with the verses affirming God's oneness and denying His humanity or having partners, reveal the inconsistency of the Trinity with both the Bible and logic. Islam provides a clear concept of God: \"Allah—there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining\" (Al-Baqarah: 255).",

          "question": "Is Jesus, peace be upon him, Muslim?",
          "answer": "To understand whether Jesus lived according to principles aligned with Islam, it's important first to consider how he expressed his reverence and relationship with God and how he worshiped and followed the teachings. Reason and logic compel us to search the texts to extract truths without bias. Let's look at the evidence from the Gospels that suggests Jesus lived a life reflecting the core of Islam, which is the oneness of God and submission to God's will. In the Gospels, Jesus demonstrates a deep commitment to prayer, which is a fundamental part of worship in Islam: Jesus Praying on the Mountain: In Matthew (14:23), it is recorded, \"After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.\" Jesus isolates himself for prayer, a practice similar to Muslims who are dedicated to praying at specific times. Jesus Praying in Gethsemane: Matthew (26:39) describes how Jesus prayed, saying, \"Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, 'My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.'\" Jesus prostrates with his face to the ground in a position that resembles the prostration in Islamic prayer. The description of Mary's attire in the Bible reflects the modesty followed by Muslim women: Mary's Head Covering: Although there is no direct mention of Mary's veil in the Gospels, traditional artistic depictions of Mary always show her wearing a head covering, reflecting her association with virtue and modesty, which aligns with Islamic values.",

          "question": "Why Jesus will return and Muhammad died and will not return?",
          "answer": "The difference in the missions of Jesus and Muhammad (peace be upon him) can be explained according to the roles each was assigned according to their religious beliefs. Jesus, according to both Islamic and Christian doctrine, did not complete his mission entirely due to his ascension to heaven and the promise of his return to complete it. On the other hand, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) completed his message by delivering the Holy Quran as a comprehensive guide and the seal of the prophethood. He declared before his death that the religion of Islam had been completed and that God had perfected His grace upon the believers; thus there is no need for his return to complete a mission because he already fulfilled it. In the Bible, it is clearly stated that Jesus will return. For example, in the Acts of the Apostles (1:11), the angels say to the disciples, \"Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come back in the same way as you have seen him go into heaven.\" This prophecy reinforces the idea of his awaited return, which is an integral part of Christian doctrine. Islam asserts that Jesus (Isa, peace be upon him) is one of God's prophets, not a deity nor the son of God, and acknowledges that he was raised to heaven and will return at the end of times to break the cross, kill the pig, denounce idol worship and polytheism, and affirm the worship of the one God. Islam considers this return as a correction of the misconceptions about his personality and teachings that were misunderstood by some. His return represents the unification of the heavenly religions under the banner of monotheism and Islam.",

          "question": "Why does Islam not consider crucifixion and atonement necessary for the salvation of humanity?",
          "answer": "The doctrine of salvation, which claims that Christ was crucified for the sins of mankind, faces several challenges from an Islamic perspective and even within the Bible itself. First, Islam emphasizes that God is the Most Forgiving and Most Merciful. He forgives sins through sincere repentance without the need for intermediaries or sacrifices. Allah says in the Quran: 'No bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another.' (Quran 6:164), meaning that every individual is accountable for their own actions. In the Bible, there is evidence supporting this principle. For instance, in Ezekiel: 'The soul who sins is the one who will die.' (Ezekiel 18:20), and in Deuteronomy: 'Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents.' (Deuteronomy 24:16). These texts reject the idea that one person bears the sins of another. Second, the Bible itself shows that sins were forgiven before the arrival of Jesus through sincere repentance. In the Gospel of Mark: 'And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.' (Mark 1:4-5). If sins could be forgiven before Jesus, why was his crucifixion necessary? Third, the notion that God needs a sacrifice to erase sins contradicts His attributes as a complete and self-sufficient deity. In Islam, God does not require bloodshed for forgiveness but rather forgives through repentance and mercy. Even in the Bible, it says: 'Let the wicked forsake their ways... and turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on them.' (Isaiah 55:7). Fourth, the Bible contains contradictions regarding the concept of atonement. If Jesus came to be crucified for humanity's sins, why do we find passages depicting him fleeing from death? In the Gospel of John: 'They picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.' (John 8:59). And in Matthew: 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' (Matthew 27:46), which reflects a rejection of the crucifixion. In conclusion, the doctrine of salvation seems inconsistent with God's justice and mercy, as well as with texts that emphasize individual accountability and the sufficiency of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",

          "question": "How can the concept of atonement and sacrifice in Christianity align with divine justice?",
          "answer": "The concept of divine love and sacrifice, particularly in John 3:16, has often been questioned on logical grounds. Divine justice requires that every individual bear responsibility for their own actions, so how can God punish an innocent person (Christ) for the sins of others? Punishing someone else for another’s sin is illogical and unethical. Islam provides a rational and consistent understanding: God forgives sins directly without the need for mediation or sacrifice. Divine forgiveness in Islam does not require complex conditions; it is based on sincere repentance and devotion, reflecting both mercy and justice. Other passages in the Bible indicate that there are many 'sons of God.' For example, 'For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God' (Romans 8:14) and 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God' (Matthew 5:9), showing that 'Son of God' can refer to a spiritual relationship, not literal only-ness. Islam emphasizes God’s infinite love and mercy. Allah says: 'My mercy encompasses all things' (Quran 7:156) and 'Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful' (Quran 2:173). The Quran explicitly denies the event of the crucifixion: 'And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them' (Quran 4:157). Allah also states: 'And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another' (Quran 6:164), affirming individual accountability. Forgiveness in Islam is achieved through repentance and righteous deeds, not through the sacrifice of an innocent person, which aligns with divine justice and logic.",

          "question": "2. Who is Jesus?",
          "answer": "In Islam, Jesus is seen as one of the mightiest prophets and messengers of God. Known as 'Isa' in Arabic, he is revered\nfor his teachings of love, compassion, humility, and righteousness. Muslims believe that he was born to the Virgin Mary\nthrough a miraculous birth that transcends human understanding. However, they reject the Christian belief that he is the\nSon of God or part of a Trinity. Instead, they regard him only as a human being who was sent by God to guide humanity\ntowards the path of righteousness. According to Islamic scripture, Jesus performed several miracles during his lifetime\nsuch as healing the blind and raising the dead - all through God's power. In fact, Muslims believe that Jesus will return in\nthe end times to restore justice to the world and defeat evil forces. Jesus holds a pivotal position in Islam - his messages\nhave been an integral part of shaping Muslim beliefs and practices until today.\nJesus, also known as Isa, is a highly respected and revered figure in Islam. He is considered to be one of\nthe greatest prophets of God, alongside Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad. Muslims believe that\nJesus was sent by God as a messenger to guide humanity towards the path of righteousness.\nIslamic accounts of Jesus’ life differ from those found in the New Testament. While both accounts agree\nthat Jesus was born of a virgin, Muslims believe that he was not actually crucified, but rather raised\nbodily into heaven by God. This belief is based on the Qur’an, which states that “they killed him not, nor\ncrucified him, but it appeared so unto them” (Surah An-Nisa 4:157).\nMuslims also believe that Jesus performed numerous miracles during his life, through the power of\nAllah. These miracles included healing the blind and lepers, raising the dead, and even creating life from\nclay. According to Islamic tradition, Jesus accomplished these miraculous feats in order to demonstrate\nthe power of God to the people.\nIn addition to performing miracles, Jesus also taught extensively about the nature of God and the\nimportance of living a virtuous life. He stressed the need to love and respect one another, and to treat\neach other with kindness and compassion. He also emphasized the importance of worshiping and\nfollowing God, and of practicing good deeds and avoiding evil behavior.\nOverall, Jesus is highly regarded in Islam as a prophet and messenger of God, who was sent to guide\nhumanity towards the path of righteousness. His teachings and miracles continue to serve as an\ninspiration and guide for Muslims today, who seek to live according to the principles of love,\ncompassion, and righteousness that he espoused.",

          "question": "3. what's Islam?",
          "answer": "Islam is based on five pillars that serve as the foundation for its practice: belief in the Oneness of God and his\nProphets, performance of prayer five times a day, giving of alms to those in need, fasting during Ramadan, and\nperforming pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime if able. Islam places great emphasis on social justice\nand moral values such as honesty, kindness, compassion and respect for one's parents, neighbors and fellow\nhuman beings. Muslims aspire to live their lives according to Islamic teachings with love for God being at its\nvery core.\nIslam is one of the fastest-growing religions in the world, with over 1.8 billion followers globally. It is a monotheistic faith\npracticed by Muslims worldwide, which is based on the teachings of the prophet Muhammad, who is considered the last\nand final prophet sent by God. Islam is best understood as a way of life that governs every aspect of an individual's life\nand encourages adherents to behave ethically and morally.\nIslam is derived from the Arabic word 'salam,' which means peace, submission, and surrender to God. The essence of\nIslam is to submit oneself to the will of God and to follow His commandments set forth in the holy book of Islam, the\nQuran. Muslims believe that the Quran is the literal word of God, revealed to the prophet Muhammad through the\narchangel Gabriel. The Quran is the primary source of guidance for both personal and community life for Muslims\nworldwide.\nIn Islam, there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger. Muslims believe in the Oneness of God and that\nHe is the Creator of everything in existence. They also believe in the Day of Judgment and that every person will be\naccountable for their actions in this life. They also believe that Prophet Muhammad gave guidance to Muslims by his\nbehaviors and teachings, known as Hadith.\nIslam respects the importance of the family, and it encourages marriage and family life. Family is considered the\ncornerstone of society, and both men and women have specific roles and responsibilities within the family. Women are\nregarded as the backbone of the family, and it is their primary responsibility to raise children and maintain the\nhousehold. Men are encouraged to provide for their families and protect them.\nFive pillars of Islam are the core of the faith and provide a framework for religious practice. They include:\n1. Shahada: Affirming that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His messenger.\n2. Salat: Performing five daily prayers.\n3. Zakat: Giving to the needy and poor.\n4. Sawm: Fasting during the month of Ramadan.\n5. Hajj: Making the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime for those who are financially and physically able.\nIn summary, Islam is a religion that emphasizes commitment to Allah, the creator, and to living a righteous and fulfilling\nlife. It provides guidance on personal relationships, family life, and societal behaviors. The religion has a rich history, and\nits followers continue to put its core values into practice.",

          "question": "4. What do you think about trinity?",
          "answer": "Islam strictly rejects the concept of the Trinity, which is the Christian belief that there are three co-equal persons\nin one Godhead- the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. Muslims firmly believe in Monotheism which\nasserts that there is only one God who governs this universe. In Islam, associating partners with Allah (Shirk) is\na great sin and ascribing divine attributes to anyone other than Allah is considered blasphemy. The Quran\nemphasizes that Allah has no progeny or associates and affirms His Oneness throughout several verses. Hence,\naccording to Islamic beliefs, any form of polytheism or tritheism is considered unacceptable and goes against\nTawheed (Oneness of God).\nIslam rejects the concept of Trinity, which is the belief that God is three persons in one: Father, Son, and\nHoly Spirit. This doctrine is an essential tenet of Christianity, but for Muslims, it contradicts the core\nprinciple of monotheism, the oneness of God. Islam teaches that God is one and indivisible, and that\nassociating partners with Him is the gravest sin. Thus, the notion of a triune God is seen as a form of\nidolatry and blasphemy.\nThe Quran strongly condemns the notion of Trinity and refutes it explicitly. The Quran says, \"Say not\n'Three' (Trinity): Desist, it will be better for you: For Allah is One God.\" (4:171). This verse emphasizes\nthe oneness of Allah and negates the idea of a plurality of persons in Godhead. It puts an end to any\nspeculation regarding the Trinity as a divine mystery.\nMoreover, the Quran highlights the semantic ambiguity of the term Trinity, which may lead to different\ninterpretations. The word \"Trinity\" is not found in the Bible. It was coined by theologians to express the\ncomplex relationship between God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. However, this concept has led to\ndivisions and disputes among Christians themselves, particularly between the Eastern and Western\nchurches.\nIslam, on the other hand, believes in the absolute unity and simplicity of God. He is not composed of\nparts or attributes that can be divided or shared. Therefore, attributing partners to God contradicts the\nvery essence of divine transcendence and uniqueness.\nFurthermore, the Islamic view of Jesus Christ as a prophet and messenger of God is different from the\nChristian notion of him as the Son of God. Muslims believe in the virgin birth of Jesus but reject the idea\nof his divinity or equal status with Allah. Instead, they see him as a human being who was chosen by\nGod to deliver his message to humanity.\nIn conclusion, Islam considers the Trinity as a theological error that distorts the doctrine of monotheism.\nMuslims believe in the absolute oneness of God, and any attempt to associate partners with Him is a sin.\nThe Quran refutes the notion of a triune God and emphasizes the simplicity and unity of Allah. Therefore,\nthe Islamic perspective on the Trinity is a clear expression of its unwavering commitment to the belief in\none God.",

          "question": "5. Is Jesus son of God?",
          "answer": "In Islam, Jesus is not considered to be the son of God. Instead, he is regarded as a prophet and messenger of\nAllah, sent to guide humanity towards the right path. Islamic beliefs hold that Allah's oneness cannot be shared\nby others in the form of children or partners. While Muslims revere Jesus and his teachings, they reject the idea\nof him being divine or having any association with God in terms of kinship. The Quran emphasizes that believing\nin the Trinity or Jesus' divinity is a grave sin against monotheism. Additionally, Muslims believe that Jesus was\nnot crucified but instead raised directly to heaven by God, and that someone else was mistakenly executed in his\nplace. Overall, while recognizing and respecting Jesus' significance as a prophet in their faith, Muslims do not\nconsider him God's son or part of a divine trinity.\nIn Islam, Jesus is considered as a highly respected and significant prophet who delivered the message\nof Allah to humanity. However, the concept of Jesus as the son of God is not accepted in Islam. The\nQuran explicitly denies the notion that God has any offspring, and thus, Jesus is not considered God's\nson in Islam.\nMuslims believe in Tawhid, the concept of the oneness of God. It is one of the fundamental beliefs of\nIslam, and the Quran emphasizes this by stating, \"Say, He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal,\nAbsolute; He neither begets nor is born, and there is nothing like Him\" (112:1-4). This verse clearly\nnegates the idea of God having a son or offspring, and hence it is not acceptable for Muslims to believe\nin Jesus as the son of God.\nMoreover, the Quran mentions the birth of Jesus, which was miraculous, as he was born to Mary, without\nany male involvement. Allah says in the Quran, \"And [mention] when the angels said, 'O Mary, indeed\nAllah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds. O Mary, be\ndevoutly obedient to your Lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow [in prayer].' That is from the\nnews of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Muhammad]. And you were not with them when they cast\ntheir pens as to which of them should be responsible for Mary. Nor were you with them when they\ndisputed\" (3:42-44). The Quran acknowledges Jesus' miraculous birth by the will of God but never\nsuggests that he is the son of God.\nThe Islamic belief in Jesus is that he was a messenger of God sent to preach the message of Islam, just\nlike other prophets. He delivered the message of submission to God, emphasizing that there is no deity\nworthy of worship except Allah. This message is the cornerstone of Islamic belief, and Muslims believe\nin Jesus as a prophet but not as the son of God.\nIn conclusion, the concept of Jesus as the son of God is not accepted in Islam. Muslims believe in the\noneness of God, and the Quran clearly negates the idea of God having any offspring. Jesus is a highly\nrespected prophet in Islam, who preached the message of submission to God. Muslims believe in Jesus\nas a messenger of God who delivered the message of Islam, but not as the son of God.",

          "question": "6. what are the differences between Islam & christianity?",
          "answer": "There are a number of key differences between Islam and Christianity. One major difference is their\nconcept of God: Christians believe in the Holy Trinity, the idea that God exists as three persons in one\n(Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), while Muslims are strictly monotheistic, believing that there is only one\nGod (Allah). Another fundamental difference lies in their holy texts: Christians follow the Bible, which\nthey believe is the inspired word of God; whereas Muslims follow the Quran, which they believe was\nrevealed to Muhammad by Allah. Similarly, Islam teaches that all prophets from Adam to Jesus were sent\nby Allah and considers Muhammad as the final prophet; while Christianity believes that Jesus is the Son\nof God and part of the Holy Trinity. Overall, these varied beliefs result in different practices for religious\nrituals, moral codes, and social customs within each faith community.\nIslam and Christianity are two of the world's largest and most widespread religions. They have different religious\nbeliefs, practices, and teachings, making them distinct from each other. In this essay, we will discuss the\nsignificant differences between Islam and Christianity.\nOne of the primary differences between Islam and Christianity relates to the concept of God. Muslims believe\nthat there is only one God, who is called Allah. Christians, on the other hand, believe in the Holy Trinity, which\nconsists of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Muslims believe that God is all-powerful, just,\nand merciful. In contrast, Christians believe that God is loving and merciful, but also just and holy.\nAnother significant difference between Islam and Christianity is the way they interpret the role of prophets.\nMuslims believe that God has revealed his message through a series of prophets, with Muhammad being the\nlast and final one. In contrast, Christians believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the ultimate prophet.\nChristians believe that Jesus was sent to earth to save humanity from sin and death.\nThe religious scriptures of both Islam and Christianity are also different. Muslims consider the Quran to be the\nverbatim word of God, revealed to Muhammad over 23 years. Christians believe in the Bible, which consists of\nthe Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament contains the Jewish scriptures, while the New Testament is\nprimarily focused on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.\nAnother significant difference between Islam and Christianity is their approach to prayer. Muslims pray five times\na day, facing Mecca. They use a prayer rug and recite prayers from the Quran. Christians, on the other hand,\nprimarily pray in church or at home. They use various aids such as prayer beads, candles, and crucifixes for\nprayer and worship.\nFinally, the way death and afterlife are perceived is different between the two religions. Muslims believe in a Day\nof Judgment when all people will be held accountable for their deeds. They believe that those who lead a good\nlife and follow the teachings of Islam will go to Paradise, while those who lead a bad life will go to Hell. Christians\nalso believe in a Day of Judgment, with those who follow Jesus going to Heaven, and those who do not going to\nHell.\nIn conclusion, Islam and Christianity are two different religions with distinct beliefs, values, and practices. The\ndifferences between these two faiths can be seen in their teachings about God, the role of prophets, religious\nscriptures, prayer, and afterlife. Despite these differences, both religions share the common goal of promoting\npeace, harmony, and brotherhood among humanity.",

          "question": "7. Jesus was the way,the Truth and the life?",
          "answer": "Islam holds that Jesus was a prophet of God and a messenger of truth, but it diverges from Christian doctrine\nwhen it comes to the belief that he was the way, the truth and the life. Islamic teachings emphasize that all\nprophets were sent by God with unique messages for specific times and communities, so while Jesus played a\nsignificant role in reminding people to turn towards God with sincere hearts, he was not the only path to reach\nHim. Instead, Islam teaches that salvation lies in adhering to the words of Muhammad as conveyed by Allah\nthrough revelation. Muslims respect Jesus as a holy figure who preached compassion and mercy towards all, but\ntheir ultimate source for guidance is the Quranic scripture which outlines a comprehensive message of worship\nand righteous conduct as well as eschatological beliefs about what will happen at the end of time.\nIslam, being one of the largest religions in the world, has its own opinion on Jesus Christ. As a prophet and\nmessenger of Allah or God, Jesus plays a significant role in Islamic beliefs. However, Islam's perspective on\nJesus differs from that of Christianity. This essay will delve into Islam's opinion regarding Jesus as the way, the\ntruth, and the life.\nThe Quran, the holy book of Muslims, acknowledges Jesus as one of the prominent prophets among many\nothers. The Quran states, \"He [Jesus] said, 'Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and\nmade me a prophet, and He has made me blessed wherever I am.'\" (19:30) As a true messenger of God, Jesus\npreached the message of monotheism - worshipping only one God. Muslims believe that Jesus was sent by God\nto guide people towards the righteous path and to warn them of the consequences of disobeying God’s will.\nIslam regards Jesus as a miracle-working prophet who cured the sick, healed the leper, and even raised the\ndead. The Quran tells the story of Jesus creating a bird out of clay and breathing life into it, which then flew\naway. (3:49) This act of God's power establishes Jesus as a supernatural prophet.\nHowever, Islam's perspective on Jesus as the way, the truth, and the life differs from that of Christianity. Muslims\nbelieve that Jesus was not God, the son of God, or part of the Trinity. According to Islamic belief, Jesus did not\ndie on the cross, nor was he resurrected. Instead, God raised him to heaven before he could be crucified.\nIslam believes that the message of Jesus was the message of submission to God, just like all the other prophets.\nMuslims believe that following the commandments of God and the teachings of His prophets is the only way to\nlead an honorable and successful life here and afterlife. Muslims do not follow any one individual or leaders, nor\ndo they believe that any one person can guarantee their salvation.\nIslam's opinion on Jesus as the way, the truth, and the life is fundamentally different from that of Christianity.\nHowever, both religions do derive guidance from the teachings of Jesus. Muslims believe that Jesus showed\npeople the right path and that the way to salvation is to follow that path. They consider the preaching of Jesus to\nbe inspiring and life-changing, as it leads one towards God's will.\nIn summary, Islam's view of Jesus as the way, the truth, and the life is one of veneration of a prophet and\nmessenger of God. Islam acknowledges Jesus's teachings and miracles while believing in different theological\nareas concerning him compared to Christian beliefs. Muslims follow Jesus's missions as a prophet, realizing that\nhis message can help them to lead a better life both in this world and in the hereafter.",

          "question": "8. Jesus had many miracles , why Muhammad didn't have any miracle?",
          "answer": "Muhammad, the founder of Islam, is frequently contrasted with Jesus Christ in several aspects. While both\nfigures are regarded as excellent prophets and significant figures in the development of religion, there are certain\naspects where their lives diverge, with Jesus performing many miracles, but Muhammad lacking them. The\nabsence of miracles in Muhammad's life has raised several questions and debates among scholars and the\ngeneral public. This essay aims to examine and explain, in detail, the reasons behind why Muhammad did not\nhave any miracles like Jesus.\nFirstly, it's necessary to understand that the purpose of miracles was different in both religions. In Christianity,\nmiracles were seen as ways to prove that Jesus Christ was the son of God and had divine powers. However, in\nIslam, the primary focus was on the Quran, which was seen as a miracle in itself. Muslims believe that the Quran\nwas directly revealed to Muhammad by Allah and is considered the final and complete revelation. Therefore,\nthere was no need for further miracles to establish the authenticity of Muhammad's message.\nSecondly, it's important to note that history is a crucial factor when understanding the lives of Jesus and\nMuhammad. Jesus lived in a time when miracles were significant; they played a crucial role in Jewish society,\nand people were looking for a messiah figure to perform them. In contrast, Muhammad lived in a time where\nrationality and science were developing. Therefore, it's possible that Muhammad avoided performing miracles to\nfocus on his teachings and mission, rather than gaining followers through wonders.\nThirdly, Muhammad's mission was different from that of Jesus. Jesus was sent to create a new covenant with\nhumanity and save humanity from sin. However, Muhammad's mission was to unite and reform the Arabian\ntribes and create a society based on justice and equality. Therefore, his focus was on spreading the message\nand teachings of Allah, rather than performing miracles.\nFinally, it's important to acknowledge that there have been several instances where Muhammad has been\nassociated with miracles. For example, the splitting of the moon, the water flowing from his fingers, and the\nfeeding of a large group of people with a small amount of food. However, these accounts are not agreed upon by\nall Muslims and are treated as less important than the teachings of the Quran.\nIn conclusion, Muhammad's lack of miracles is not a weakness in his claim as a prophet. Instead, it highlights the\nunique nature of his message and mission. His focus was on spreading the message of Allah and creating a just\nand equal society. The Quran was seen as his primary miracle, and he devoted much of his life to teaching and\nspreading its message. Therefore, Muhammad's message and teachings remain just as powerful and influential\ntoday as they were during his lifetime.",

          "question": "9. Why is pork prohibited in Islam?",
          "answer": "Pork is prohibited in Islam due to a clear directive mentioned in the holy book of Quran. Muslims believe that\nAllah (God) has prohibited the consumption of pork for several reasons, including health, moral and spiritual\npurposes. According to Islamic teachings, pigs are considered unclean animals and therefore their meat is also\nunclean. Pigs have a low digestive ability thus they consume anything which makes them susceptible to\ndiseases that can be transmitted to humans upon consumption of their meat. Additionally, pork contains toxins\nand harmful substances like cholesterol which may lead to various health problems such as obesity or heart\ndisease. Pork consumption is seen as a temptation towards indulgence in worldly pleasures by some scholars;\nthe lack of control over one's desires is not encouraged in Islam. Therefore, refraining from the consumption of\npork is believed to preserve an individual’s physical well-being as well as maintain spiritual purity and self-control\nwithin the Muslim community.\nPork is one of the most commonly consumed meats worldwide. However, in Islam, pork is one of the prohibited\nfoods, and Muslims are forbidden from consuming it or cooking it. This prohibition of eating pork is not only a\nreligious obligation in Islam but also has several scientific reasons. This essay will address why pork is prohibited\nin Islam, both from religious and scientific perspectives.\nFrom a religious viewpoint, pork is prohibited in the Islamic faith as it has been stated in the Quran; \"forbidden to\nyou are dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah.\" (Surah\nAl-Ma'idah: 3). This indicates that pork is impure and harmful to human consumption, and it has been forbidden\nby Allah. This prohibition of pork is not only limited to Muslims but also Jews and some Christian sects, as it is\nmentioned in the Bible (Leviticus 11:7-8).\nFurthermore, pigs and other prohibited animals have been mentioned by the Prophet Muhammad in the Hadith,\none of the Islamic scholars' compilations. The Prophet Muhammad mentioned: \"A true believer does not eat\nblood, a dead animal, or pork.\" (Bukhari, Muslim) The Prophet highlighted the severity of consuming pork,\nmaking it clear that it is strictly forbidden in Islam.\nFrom a scientific perspective, pork is a dirty and high-risk meat to consume, which can cause numerous health\nissues. Pigs are the scavengers of the animal kingdom and are known for consuming anything they find,\nincluding feces, urine, and other contaminated food. This means that their flesh contains harmful bacteria and\ntoxins such as Salmonella, E.Coli, and Trichinella, which cause food poisoning and other serious illnesses.\nMoreover, pigs carry several viruses and parasites, including tapeworms, viruses that lead to swine flu, and\ninfluenza, which can cause severe diseases like meningitis, and even death. Additionally, pork has high-fat\ncontent, which contributes to obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.\nIn conclusion, pork is prohibited in Islam due to religious and scientific reasons. Islam prohibits consuming pork\nto maintain cleanliness, purity, and good health. Pig's habitat and dietary habits increase the risk of food\npoisoning, viruses, and parasites. Therefore, Muslims follow the rules stated in Quran and Prophet’s Hadiths to\navoid the harmful effects of pork consumption. Additionally, this prohibition plays a significant role in maintaining\nand promoting the Islamic ethics of cleanliness, which is essential in daily life.\n10. Jesus is the word of God in islam\nIn Islam, Jesus is considered a revered prophet and messenger of Allah. He is also known as the word of God,\nor Kalimatullah, because he was born through the miraculous power of Allah's spoken word. The Quran affirms\nthat Jesus brought divine guidance to humanity, preaching love and compassion for all people. However, Muslim\nbeliefs about Jesus differ from those of Christianity in that Muslims do not view him as the son of God nor do\nthey believe in his crucifixion and resurrection. Rather, they believe that he was miraculously raised into heaven\nbefore his captors could harm him. Furthermore, Muslims believe that their faith completes and supersedes\nearlier religious traditions and accepts Jesus' teachings within a larger framework of Islamic monotheism.\nTherefore, when Muslims refer to Jesus as the word of God, they acknowledge his prophetic status within Islam\nwhile underscoring his unique relationship to Allah's divine utterance.\nThe phrase \"Jesus is the word of God\" is often used in Islamic contexts, and it refers to Jesus' unique role in the\nMuslim faith as a messenger of God. In the Quran, the holy book of Islam, Jesus is frequently referred to as the\n\"word\" or \"kalimah\" of God. The Quranic description of Jesus as the word of God establishes a crucial\nconnection between Jesus and the divine, and it reflects the Islamic belief in the singular nature of God's\nmessage.\nAt the heart of the Islamic understanding of Jesus as the word of God is the belief that Jesus was a prophet who\nwas chosen by God to convey His message to humanity. According to the Quran, Jesus was sent to the world to\nteach people about the truth of God's message and to guide them towards a life of obedience to God's will. In\nthis sense, Jesus was seen as a word that conveyed God's message to humanity.\nThe Quranic description of Jesus as the word of God also emphasizes the divine nature of Jesus. According to\nIslamic belief, Jesus was not just an ordinary person, but he was a manifestation of the divine message that God\nsent down to humanity. The Quranic verses that describe Jesus as the word of God emphasize his unique\nposition as a messenger of God, and they echo the Islamic belief in the oneness of God's message.\nIn addition to emphasizing the divine nature of Jesus, the Quranic description of him as the word of God also\nhighlights the importance of the message that he brought to humanity. According to Islamic belief, Jesus'\nteachings were a continuation of the prophetic tradition that had been established by earlier prophets. His\nmessage was about the importance of living a life of obedience to God's will, and it emphasized the importance\nof compassion and social justice.\nUltimately, the Quranic description of Jesus as the word of God serves to emphasize the centrality of the divine\nmessage in the Islamic faith. It highlights the belief that God's message is a unifying force that transcends time\nand place, and that it is delivered to humanity through a series of divinely inspired messengers. By emphasizing\nthe importance of Jesus' message, the Quranic description of him as the word of God reinforces the importance\nof living a life of faith and submission to God's will.",

          "question": "11. Is Jesus God?",
          "answer": "From the Islamic point of view, Jesus is considered a prophet and a revered figure in spiritual history. However,\nMuslims reject the idea that Jesus is God or the son of God as inferior to Allah’s supreme authority. Instead, they\nuphold the belief in monotheism which says that there is only one true God- Allah. Muslims hold Jesus in high\nesteem as an important messiah and messenger of Allah who was born miraculously but appointed as a human\nbeing with no divine properties. In Islam, emphasizing that Jesus was born without any filial link to divinity\nsignifies submitting to God's will and understanding his Oneness. Furthermore, the Qur'an teaches that idolizing\nanyone besides Allah constitutes blasphemy (shirk) – an unforgivable sin. Thus, from an Islamic lens, denying\nJesus’ divine nature does not detract from his unique position as an esteemed Prophet and guardian of Muslim\nbeliefs in ethical teachings such as compassion, equality, and justice.\nIslam, like Christianity, recognizes the importance of Jesus in the world. Muslims believe Prophet Jesus was a\nprophet of Allah or God. The foundation of Islam is the belief in tawhid or the Oneness of God. In the Islamic\nfaith, Jesus is regarded as an important prophet or messenger of God, but he is not seen as God or a divine\nbeing.\nThe Islamic view of Jesus is quite different from the Christian view of Jesus. While Christianity believes Jesus\nwas the son of God and a part of the Holy Trinity, Islam strictly denies the concept of the Trinity. Muslims believe\nthat Jesus was a mortal human being who was chosen by God to be a prophet and deliverer of His message.\nJesus' miraculous birth to the Virgin Mary was believed to be a miraculous event, but it does not make him\ndivine.\nMuslims regard Jesus as one of the great prophets who was sent to guide the people of Israel. According to the\nQuran, Jesus was sent to confirm the previous prophets' teachings and to warn people to follow God's\ncommandments. Islam believes that Jesus performed some miraculous things through the permission of God,\nsuch as healing the blind and the sick, and raising the dead. But Muslims also believe that Jesus' abilities were\nnot attributed to him alone; rather, they were God's power and enabled by Allah’s permission.\nThe Quran recognizes Jesus as the Messiah, a title bestowed not only on Jesus but also on Prophet Muhammad\n(peace be upon him). The title Messiah indicates a messenger or savior of God, but it does not imply divinity.\nMuslims accept that Jesus was crucified by the Romans, although the Quran denies that he died on the cross.\nThe Quran says that God raised Jesus to Himself, and he will return in the last days as a just leader who will\nestablish righteousness on the earth.\nIn conclusion, Islam does not consider Jesus as God, but purely as a prophet of Allah with no divine nature.\nWhile Muslim does not deny Jesus' great significance in history, they make it clear that considering him God is a\nsin in the religion. Muslims respect Jesus’ teachings and believe in his second coming, but they have a\ndistinctive point of view from the Christian’s belief in Jesus Christ being divine. It reinforces to Muslims that they\nshould devote their worship and gratitude towards the one and only God, Allah.",

          "question": "12. Jesus will return,why not Muhammad?",
          "answer": "According to Islamic belief, Jesus will return as a prophet before the end of times. However, it is important to\nnote that Muhammad is considered the last and final prophet in Islam, making it impossible for him to return after\nhis passing. Muslims strongly believe that Jesus will no longer be a deity upon his return but rather a messenger\nwho will clarify misconceptions about his earlier years on earth. As narrated in various Hadiths (sayings of\nProphet Muhammad), Jesus is expected to kill Dajjal (the Antichrist) and will lead prayers as an Imam for\nMuslims. Although there are differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs about Jesus’ return, the former\nencourages all its followers to respect Christ and consider him one of the greatest messengers sent by Allah\n(God).\nIslam regards Jesus (peace be upon him) as one of the greatest prophets of Allah (God). Muslims believe in his\nmiraculous birth, his ability to perform miracles, and his ascension to heaven without facing death. In Islam,\nJesus is expected to return to this world, and his return is an important aspect of Islamic eschatology (end of\ntimes). However, Islam differs from Christianity in the nature and timing of Jesus' return.\nIn Islam, it is believed that Jesus will return to establish justice and peace on earth. He will descend from the\nheavens, accompanied by angels, at a time when the world is engulfed in chaos and tyranny. His role will be to\nunite people under the banner of Islam and establish a just and ethical society. The Quran mentions Jesus'\nreturn in several verses:\n\"And (Jesus) shall be a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment): therefore have no doubt about the\n(Hour), but you (should) follow Me: this is a Straight Way.\" (43:61)\n\"He (Jesus) said: 'I am indeed a servant of Allah. He has given me revelation and made me a prophet; and He\nhas made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined on me Prayer and Charity as long as I live; (He) has\nmade me kind to my mother, and not overbearing or miserable; so peace is on me the day I was born, the day I\ndie, and the day I shall be raised up to life (again)!'\" (19:30-33)\nHowever, Islam's view of Jesus' return and his role in the end of times differs from the Christian view, which\nregards Jesus' return as the final judgment day. Islam does not regard Jesus as a divine figure, but rather as a\nprophet of Allah. Therefore, Muslims do not believe that Jesus will return to save humanity in the sense that\nChristians understand it.\nAs for why Muhammad will not return, Islam holds that he was the last prophet sent by Allah to guide humanity.\nThe Quran says:\n\"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of Allah, and the Seal of the\nProphets: and Allah has full knowledge of all things.\" (33:40)\nThis verse indicates that Muhammad was the last prophet of Allah, and after him there will be no further\nprophets. Therefore, his role as a prophet has been fulfilled, and he will not return to earth.\nIn conclusion, Islam believes in Jesus' return to establish justice and peace on earth, but it differs from the\nChristian view in the nature and timing of his return. While Muhammad is regarded as the last prophet of Allah\nand will not return to earth, his teachings and guidance continue to inspire and guide Muslims.",

          "question": "13. Do Muslims worship Kabbah & black stone?",
          "answer": "I can confidently assert that Muslims do not worship the Kaaba or black stone. The Kaaba itself is a cuboid\nstructure in Mecca towards which Muslims face while performing their prayers. This is because the direction of\nprayer (qiblah) was initially set towards Jerusalem, but later it was changed to Makkah (the location of the\nKaaba) by Prophet Muhammad under divine instruction. The Black Stone is merely a sacred object located on\none corner of the Kaaba and holds significance as it is believed to have come from heaven. Muslims perform a\nritual during Hajj or Umrah in which they kiss or touch the Black Stone as part of their pilgrimage, but it does not\nhold any essential religious meaning beyond this act - it's just a revered symbol akin to other holy artifacts of\nother religions. In short, the worship among Muslims is directed solely towards Allah and not any physical object.\nThere is a widespread misconception among non-Muslims that Muslims worship the Kabah and the black stone.\nHowever, this belief is entirely unfounded and based on a lack of understanding of Islamic theology and history.\nFirstly, it is crucial to understand that Muslim worship is directed solely towards Allah, the one and only God in\nIslam. Muslims believe that Allah is the sole creator of the universe and that he is the only being worthy of\nworship. Thus, to suggest that Muslims worship any physical object, including the Kabah or the black stone, is\nentirely inaccurate.\nThe Kabah, which means \"cube\" in Arabic, is a sacred site located in the city of Mecca. Muslims consider it to be\nthe first house of worship established by Adam and later rebuilt by the Prophet Ibrahim and his son Ismail. The\nKabah is regarded as the holiest site in Islam and functions as a focal point for Muslim prayer and pilgrimage.\nHowever, it is vital to understand that Muslims do not worship the Kabah as an object of veneration. Instead, the\nKabah serves as a symbol of the oneness of God and the unity of the Muslim community. Muslims believe that\nthe Kabah is a physical manifestation of the divine presence of Allah, but it is not to be worshipped as an idol or\na deity.\nSimilarly, the black stone, a small corner stone embedded in the eastern wall of the Kabah, is also held in high\nregard by Muslims. According to Islamic tradition, the black stone was given to Prophet Ibrahim by the angel\nGabriel and is believed to possess healing powers. Pilgrims to the Kabah perform a ritual called tawaf, in which\nthey walk around the Kabah seven times, and kiss or touch the black stone.\nHowever, this act of touching or kissing the black stone is not an act of worship, but rather a symbolic gesture of\none's devotion and obedience to Allah. The black stone is considered a blessed stone, but it has no divine or\nmagical powers, and Muslims do not worship it as an object of veneration.\nIn conclusion, it is entirely incorrect to suggest that Muslims worship the Kabah or the black stone. Muslim\nworship is directed solely towards Allah, and these physical objects serve only as symbols of Muslim unity,\ndevotion, and submission to God. Muslims engage in acts of homage towards these objects as a means of\nexpressing their faith and connection to Islamic tradition, but they do not worship them as idols or deities. It is\nessential to understand the distinctions and nuances of Islamic faith and practice to avoid misconceptions and\nmisinterpretations.",

          "question": "14. Does Muhammad have miracles?",
          "answer": "In Islam, Muhammad is revered as a prophet and messenger of Allah.. One such event includes the night\njourney (al-Isra) in which Muhammad was transported from Mecca to Jerusalem, and then ascended to heaven\n(Mi'raj). Additionally, it is believed that his ability to recite and utter the Quran without any prior learning or\ntraining is also considered miraculous. Overall, these occurrences serve as manifestations of God’s guidance\nthrough His chosen prophet and reinforce the truthfulness of Islam as a faith-based on divine revelation rather\nthan human interpretation.\nIslam, like many other religions, attributes miracles to its founder, Prophet Muhammad. The existence and nature\nof these miracles are a topic of much debate among Muslim scholars, with some viewing them as literal events\nwhile others interpret them more symbolically. In this essay, we will explore the various arguments surrounding\nthe question of whether Muhammad had miracles in Islam.\nThe concept of miracles (known as karamat or mu'jizat in Arabic) is central to Islamic theology. Muslims believe\nthat Allah, the supreme being, possesses the power to intervene in the natural order of things and perform acts\nthat defy human logic and understanding. As the last prophet of Islam, Muhammad is said to have been granted\nthe ability to perform miracles as a sign of his divine connection and authority.\nOne of the most famous miracles attributed to Muhammad is his splitting of the moon. This event is referenced in\nseveral places in the Quran, including in Surah Al-Qamar (Verse 1), which states, \"The hour has come near, and\nthe moon has split [in two]. And if they see a miracle, they turn away and say, ‘Passing magic.’\" Some scholars\ninterpret this passage as a metaphorical reference to a political or social schism, while others believe it to be a\nliteral account of Muhammad splitting the moon in two.\nAnother commonly cited miracle is the Prophet's night journey (Al-Isra), during which he is believed to have\ntraveled from Mecca to Jerusalem and then ascended to the heavens. This event is detailed in Surah Al-Isra\n(Verse 1), which states, \"Exalted is He who took His Servant by night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid\nal-Aqsa, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the\nSeeing.\" Some scholars view this event as a physical journey, while others interpret it as a spiritual experience.\nOther miracles attributed to Muhammad include his ability to predict future events, his healing of the sick, and his\nsplitting of the rock at Hira. However, some Muslim scholars reject these accounts as exaggerated or fabricated.\nIn conclusion, the question of whether Muhammad had miracles in Islam is a complex one that continues to be\ndebated among scholars. While some believe in the literal truth of the reported miracles, others view them as\nmetaphorical expressions of Muhammad's spiritual power and authority. Regardless of one's interpretation, these\nmiracles serve as a powerful symbol of Muhammad's role as a messenger of Allah and a guiding force for\nMuslims around the world.",

          "question": "15. Is Jesus the spirit of God?",
          "answer": "In Islam, Jesus is recognized as a great prophet and messenger of Allah, but not as the son of God. Instead, he\nis considered a human being who was greatly blessed by God with miracles and teachings for the guidance of\nmankind. While there are different interpretations within Islamic theology, most would agree that Jesus was not\ndivine nor did he embody the spirit of God in the way that is understood in Christianity. Rather, Muslims believe\nthat God's spirit is present in all of creation and accessible to humanity through prayer and spiritual practices.\nTherefore, while Jesus holds an important position in Islamic theology, his role is distinct from that described by\nChristians, who see him as both fully human and fully divine.\nIslam is a monotheistic religion that regards Prophet Muhammad as the last and final messenger of God. The\nQuranic teachings recognize Jesus as a prophet of God, born of the Virgin Mary, and performing miraculous acts\nsuch as healing the sick and raising the dead. However, the Islamic view of Jesus differs from the Christian view,\nwhich regards him as the son of God and the incarnation of the divine spirit. According to Islam, Jesus is not the\nspirit of God, but a human messenger sent by God to guide humanity towards the path of righteousness.\nThe Islamic understanding of God is based on the concept of Tawhid, which acknowledges the oneness and\nunity of God. Muslims believe that God is the ultimate source of all existence, and that nothing can be compared\nto God in essence or nature. Therefore, it is considered a grave sin in Islam to associate partners with God, or to\nattribute divine attributes to anything other than God. This fundamental principle of Tawhid is reflected in the\nIslamic view of Jesus, who is regarded as a mortal being created by God, and not as a divine being possessing\nthe spirit of God.\nThe Quranic teachings describe Jesus as a prophet who was sent to guide the children of Israel towards the\npath of righteousness. Jesus performed miracles such as healing the sick, raising the dead, and speaking from\nhis cradle as an infant, all of which were regarded as signs of his prophethood. According to the Quran, Jesus\nwas born of the Virgin Mary, and he spent his life preaching the message of God to his people. However, the\nQuranic account of Jesus's life differs from the Christian view in several respects. For example, the Quran denies\nthe Christian doctrine of the Trinity, and the divinity of Jesus.\nIn Islam, the spirit of God is regarded as a separate entity from Jesus, who is considered a human being.\nMuslims believe that the spirit of God is a divine force that pervades all of creation, including humanity.\nAccording to the Quranic teachings, the spirit of God is not confined to a particular place or time, but is\nomnipresent and eternal. Therefore, it cannot be equated with Jesus, who is a finite being bound by the\nlimitations of time and space.\nIn conclusion, Islam does not regard Jesus as the spirit of God, but as a messenger sent by God to guide\nhumanity towards righteousness. Muslims believe in the oneness of God, and reject the notion of associating\npartners with God. Therefore, the Islamic view of Jesus differs from the Christian view, and emphasizes his role\nas a prophet and messenger, rather than his divinity or incarnation of the spirit of God.",

          "question": "16. Jesus doesn't have a sin, but Muhammad has a sin?",
          "answer": "it is important to provide clarity on the concept of sin in Christianity and Islam. According to Christian doctrine,\nJesus Christ was born without original sin and lived a perfect life, making him the only sinless human being who\never existed. On the other hand, Islamic teachings acknowledge that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was not\ninfallible, but believe that he sought repentance whenever he made mistakes or errors in judgment. It is\nimportant to remember that both Christianity and Islam emphasize the importance of seeking forgiveness for\none's transgressions towards God and fellow humans. Therefore, whether or not a religious figure has sinned\ndoes not diminish their respective faiths' importance on moral values such as love, compassion, and empathy\ntowards others.\nit is not programmed to support or promote religious biases. Therefore, this essay will not make any claims or\nassertions about the historical or religious significance of Jesus Christ or Muhammad. However, it is essential to\nexplore the origin and notion of sin in Islam and Christianity.\nIn the Christian faith, sin refers to any violation against God's laws or divine principles. The story of Adam and\nEve in the book of Genesis describes the origins of sin-how it entered the world and how it affects humanity.\nChristians believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to earth to save humanity from the consequences of\nsin-broken fellowship with God, death, and eternal separation from Him. According to the Bible, Jesus Christ\nlived a perfect, sinless life, making him the only suitable sacrifice for the atonement of sin, as well as\ndemonstrating the way to live a sinless life.\nThe concept of sin in Islam is different. Muslims believe that Allah (God) created humans pure, without sin, and\nwith the ability to recognize right from wrong. However, humans are prone to sin due to shaytan or Satan's\ntemptation, their own desires, or other external factors. Sin, known as 'dhanb' in Arabic, means to act against\nGod's commands, forgetting God, or hurting others physically or mentally. Muslims believe that the prophets and\nmessengers of God, including Muhammad, are sinless in terms of receiving divine revelations. However, they\nare not perfect, and as humans, they can make mistakes, repent and learn from them.\nTherefore, we cannot say that Muhammad or any prophet or messenger of Allah has sinned. However, they are\nnot immune to errors and have admitted to making mistakes. Muhammad, for example, once ordered the killing\nof a group of people who had assassinated some of his followers. Later, when he learned about their\nrepentance, he regretted his decision and asked for forgiveness. This incident shows that even the best of\nMuslims can make mistakes and need to seek forgiveness.\nIt is essential to avoid making comparisons that could offend either religion or its followers. Both Islam and\nChristianity teach the importance of forgiveness and repentance. Muslims believe that God's mercy is vast and\nthat He forgives all sins, except for shirk or associating partners with Him. Christians believe that through faith in\nJesus Christ, believers can receive forgiveness for their sins and eternal life with Him.\nIn conclusion, both Islam and Christianity acknowledge the significance of sin and the need for forgiveness. The\nconcept of sin in Islam and Christianity differs; however, both religions reveal that even the best of their followers\ncan make mistakes and need to seek forgiveness. Therefore, rather than comparing and contrasting the lives of\nJesus and Muhammad, it is best to focus on what we can learn from their teachings, repenting and seeking\nforgiveness from God for our mistakes.",

          "question": "17. Why do Muslims pray in Arabic?",
          "answer": "Muslims pray in Arabic because it is the language of the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam. The use of Arabic\nmaintains the authenticity and accuracy of reciting Allah's revelations as stated in the Qur'an, which are believed\nto be pure and unaltered since its inception over 1,400 years ago. Furthermore, recitation in Arabic helps\nMuslims to better connect with their faith by instilling a sense of unity among global worshippers. It acts as a\ncohesive element that binds different communities who may speak different languages but can still communicate\nwith one another through prayers recited in standardized uniformity. Additionally, Quranic verses carry deep\nspiritual meanings that cannot be fully expressed in translation without losing some essence or subtlety.\nTherefore Muslims pray in Arabic not just for ritualistic reasons but also for the transcendent experience it offers\nthrough meditative prayer practices embedded within Islamic spiritual traditions.\nMuslims pray in Arabic because it is the language of the Islamic holy book, the Quran. The Quran is the direct\nword of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad in the Arabic language over 1,400 years ago. Since the\nQuran is considered to be the ultimate source of guidance for Muslims, it is natural that prayers are also\nconducted in Arabic.\nMoreover, the Arabic language has a special status in Islam, not only because it is the language of the\nProphet Muhammad and the Quran but also because it has been chosen by God as the language of the\nfinal revelation. The Quran itself refers to Arabic as a \"clear language\" (Quran 26:195) that is easy to\nunderstand and has a depth of meaning that cannot be fully translated into other languages.\nWhen Muslims pray in Arabic, they are not only communicating with God but are also connecting with\nthe rich history and spiritual tradition of Islam. Arabic language is often used in the daily life of Muslims\nin the form of phrases like \"Assalamu alaikum\" (peace be upon you) and \"Bismillah\" (in the name of\nAllah). Therefore, the Arabic language has become integral to Muslim culture.\nAdditionally, Arabic is a unifying language for Muslims all around the world. Regardless of cultural and\nethnic differences, Muslims are united through their shared faith and shared language. Therefore,\npraying in Arabic helps to foster a sense of community and togetherness among Muslims.\nIt is also important to note that while Arabic is the primary language used in Islamic prayers, Muslims\nmay also recite prayers in their own native languages during non-obligatory or voluntary prayers, such\nas the night prayer of \"tahajjud\" or the \"dua\" (supplication) after the obligatory prayers. These additional\nprayers are recited in the local language of the Muslim community to help them better understand the\nmeaning and importance of the prayers.\nIn conclusion, Muslims pray in Arabic because it is the language of the Quran, which is the ultimate\nsource of guidance for Muslims. Additionally, the Arabic language is an essential part of Muslim culture\nand has significant spiritual and cultural importance. It also unifies Muslims from all over the world,\nregardless of their cultural and ethnic differences. While obligatory prayers are recited in Arabic,\nMuslims have the freedom to use their native languages during other voluntary prayers",

          "question": "18. \"the father and I are one\" ,is that true?",
          "answer": "From a Muslim point of view, the statement \"the father and I are one\" can be understood in reference to the\noneness of Allah (SWT). In Islam, there is the concept of Tawhid which means the belief in the oneness and\nunity of Allah. The statement can also be interpreted as a way for individuals to draw closer to Allah by\ndeveloping a stronger relationship with Him through love, fear, and obedience. This understanding affirms that\nMuslims believe in the complete oneness and indivisibility of God, without any partners or associates. The idea\nthat we are one with Allah is not meant to imply any form of divinity or inherent power; rather it conveys humility\nand submission towards Him. As proclaimed by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), \"Allah has said: He who has\nknown himself knows his Lord.\" By knowing oneself and acknowledging our dependency upon Him, we connect\nourselves with Allah's mercy, compassion and guidance.\nThe phrase \"the father and I are one\" originates from the Gospel of John in the Christian Bible, where\nJesus is quoted as saying this in the context of describing his relationship with God the Father. This\nstatement is often used to support the Christian belief in the doctrine of the Trinity, which teaches that\nGod exists as three persons in one: the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. However, the\nquestion posed here is whether this statement holds any significance in Islamic theology.\nTo begin with, it is important to note that Islam and Christianity have different understandings of who\nGod is. While Christians believe in a three-in-one God, Muslims, on the other hand, believe in a single,\nindivisible God (Allah). Therefore, the idea of Jesus and the Father being one is not in line with Islamic\nteachings.\nIn Islam, the oneness of God is one of the most fundamental beliefs, known as Tawheed. Muslims believe\nthat Allah is the only deity and that He has no partners, equals, or associates. In the Quran, Allah (swt)\nsays, \"Say, He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is\nthere to Him any equivalent\" (112:1-4).\nThe phrase \"the father and I are one\" cannot be attributed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) because it is\nnot found in the Quran, nor is it spoken by the Prophet. Instead, the Quran teaches that Allah is unseen\nand incomparable, and that he alone is the ultimate and true authority.\nIn Islamic theology, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is considered the last and final messenger of Allah.\nHe is considered a human being with no attributes of divinity, and his purpose was to deliver the\nmessage of God to humanity. Therefore, there is no room for any claim of oneness with Allah in Islam.\nIn conclusion, the statement \"the father and I are one\" holds no significance in Islamic theology. Islam\nteaches the belief in the absolute unity of God and the idea of the Trinity is considered a deviation from\nthe monotheistic belief. Contrarily, Islam instructs its followers to put their complete trust in Allah and to\nsubmit themselves to Him alone. Muslims, therefore, hold very different beliefs from Christians on this\nmatter.",

          "question": "19. No one can see God except through Jesus?",
          "answer": "According to Islamic beliefs, the statement \"No one can see God except through Jesus\" goes against the\nfundamental concept of Tawheed or oneness of God. While Muslims greatly revere Prophet Jesus as a\nmessenger of Allah, they do not consider him to be divine or a mediator between human beings and God.\nRather, Islam teaches that every individual has direct access to God through sincere prayers and worship\nwithout the need for an intermediary. The Quran mentions in numerous verses that Allah is All-Seeing and\nAll-Hearing, implying that He is always present and attentive to His creations' supplications. Hence, the notion\nthat only through Jesus can one perceive God is not embraced in Islam as it contradicts with the belief in\nmonotheism upheld by Muslims worldwide.\nThe statement \"No one can see God except through Jesus\" is a Christian belief that Jesus Christ is the\nonly way to God. However, Islam, which is the second-largest religion in the world, has a different\nperspective on this statement.\nIslam teaches that every individual has the potential to see and connect with God through personal\ndevotion and seeking knowledge. In Islam, Allah is portrayed as one who is transcendent and infinite,\nand thus, cannot be seen or comprehended by human faculties.\nIslam emphasizes the importance of surrendering to the will of Allah, and seeking his guidance and\nmercy. The way to do so is by following the teachings of the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, and\nthe example of the Prophet Mohammed.\nIslam also teaches that Jesus was a prophet and a messenger of God, but not divine. Muslims believe\nthat God can reveal himself to anyone he chooses, and there have been many examples throughout the\nhistory of Islam of people who have had spiritual experiences with God.\nMuslims believe that the way to experience God is through prayer, worship, and serving others. In Islam,\nthe concept of Tawhid, or the oneness of God, is central to the faith. Muslims believe that everything in\nthe universe is interconnected and that the ultimate purpose is to submit to the will of Allah.\nIn conclusion, the statement \"No one can see God except through Jesus\" is a Christian belief, and it\ndoes not apply to Islam. In Islam, the way to connect with God is through surrendering to his will,\nseeking his guidance, and serving others. Islam emphasizes that everyone has the potential to connect\nwith Allah and experience his presence. Muslims believe that Jesus was a prophet and a messenger of\nGod, and although his teachings are respected, he is not the only way to God.",

          "question": "20. What's the meaning of Jihad?",
          "answer": "Jihad refers to the struggle or effort made by an individual in the pursuit of righteousness and the betterment of\nsociety. In Islamic terms, this concept carries a deeper connotation that involves spiritual, social, and physical\nstruggles aimed at achieving a righteous and just society. Jihad is frequently associated with military campaigns\nwaged against non-believers, but this is a misinterpretation. Islam emphasizes peace, but acknowledges that\nthere may be situations where self-defense is necessary. The greater Jihad in Islam is to strive towards\nindividual spiritual development by engaging in regular prayer and participating in charitable activities for\ncommunity improvement. Jihad does not condone violence against innocent people or aggression towards\nnon-Muslim communities. Instead, it promotes courage and determination to resist oppression and uphold the\nprinciples of justice and freedom for all individuals irrespective of their religious affiliation or background.\nJihad is one of the most widely misunderstood Islamic concepts. It is often associated with violence and\nterrorism, particularly by some Western media outlets. However, the term has a much broader and\ncomplex meaning than this simplistic portrayal.\nIn Arabic, Jihad means “struggle” or “effort,” and it has both spiritual and physical dimensions. The\nspiritual Jihad involves a personal struggle to improve oneself and overcome one’s inner weaknesses,\nsuch as greed, arrogance, and envy. It aims to purify one’s intentions and actions, develop a closer\nrelationship with God, and attain spiritual excellence. This type of Jihad is, in fact, the most important\nand the highest form of struggle, as the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, “The most\nexcellent Jihad is that for the conquest of self.”\nThe physical Jihad, on the other hand, involves a struggle against enemies of Islam, particularly those\nwho threaten the safety and security of Muslims and their lands. However, this type of Jihad is often\nmisinterpreted as a call for indiscriminate violence or aggression against non-Muslims. In reality, Islam\nencourages peaceful coexistence and forbids any form of aggression or harm to non-combatants,\nwhether Muslim or non-Muslim.\nIn Islamic terms, the physical Jihad has certain conditions and regulations that must be observed.\nFirstly, it can only be declared by a legitimate authority or leader, not by individuals or groups acting on\ntheir own accord. Secondly, it can only be defensive in nature, aimed at repelling an attack or defending\nagainst aggression. Thirdly, it must be proportionate, meaning that the force used must be proportional\nto the threat faced. Fourthly, it must avoid harming non-combatants or causing unnecessary destruction.\nLastly, it must be conducted in accordance with Islamic ethics and values, such as compassion,\nfairness, and justice.\nMoreover, Jihad also has non-violent forms, which are equally important in fulfilling its objectives. These\ninclude the Jihad of the tongue, which involves speaking truthfully, arguing with wisdom and patience,\nand spreading knowledge and awareness of Islam. It also includes the Jihad of the pen, which involves\nwriting and publishing Islamic works that counter myths and misunderstandings about Islam and\npresent its true teachings in a comprehensive and persuasive manner.\nIn conclusion, Jihad is a multi-faceted and nuanced concept in Islam that includes both spiritual and\nphysical dimensions. It is not a call for senseless violence, but a struggle to uphold Islamic values and\nprinciples, defend against oppression and aggression, and achieve personal and collective excellence.\nUnderstanding the true meaning of Jihad is essential for promoting peace, tolerance, and mutual respect\nbetween Muslims and non-Muslims, and combating extremist ideologies that hijack the concept for their\nown nefarious aims.",

          "question": "21. Are Muslims terrorists?",
          "answer": "In reality, the overwhelming majority of Muslims condemn terrorism and seek peaceful coexistence with people\nof all religions. It is critical to recognize that terrorism does not discriminate based on ethnicity, religion or\nnationality; rather it is a result of multifaceted geopolitical issues fueled by extremism and lack of socio-economic\nopportunities in conflict-ridden regions. By educating ourselves on the true principles of Islam and rejecting\nharmful stereotypes, we can foster mutual understanding and constructive dialogue between different faiths,\nleading to a more peaceful world.\nThe label of terrorism has been attached to many groups and individuals worldwide, but when it comes\nto Muslims, it is an especially controversial issue. There are a number of reasons why some people\nconsider Muslims to be terrorists, and they aren’t always clear or straightforward. However, some\nfactors that contribute to this perception are religious extremism, misinterpreted beliefs, culture shock,\nand media propaganda.\nOne essential factor that contributes to the misperception of Muslims as terrorists is religious\nextremism. Although it is a minority belief, some Muslims have distorted the teachings of the Quran and\nthe Islamic faith in their attempt to justify violent acts or jihad. This extremism is often fueled by political\nagendas, national grievances, and territorial conflicts that many consider to be part of a wider clash of\ncivilizations, a clash between the Muslim world and the West. These terrorists, who take innocent lives\nand spread fear and terror among communities, severely damage the perception of Muslims worldwide.\nAnother factor that contributes to the perception of Muslims as terrorists is the misunderstanding and\nmisinterpretation of Islamic teachings by some people. Although Islam is a religion of peace, some\npeople interpret and execute actions based on their own beliefs, which are not necessarily\nrepresentative of the mainstream Muslim opinion. Islam has been stigmatized by some extremist groups\ninvolved in terrorist activities, which have left a lasting negative impression on many non-Muslims, even\nthough the vast majority of Muslims would reject these extremist teachings.\nCulture shock can be another factor that contributes to this phenomenon. It is very human to fear things\nthat we don’t understand or are unfamiliar with, and that's exactly what happens with many of the\ncommunities who receive Muslim immigrants. Many people do not have any direct encounter with\npeople of Muslim faith, and their only exposure is based on caricatures they see on TV or read in the\nnews. As a result, they assume that all Muslims share the same beliefs and that they pose a threat to\ntheir security and values.\nFinally, media representation plays a significant role in the stigmatization of Muslims as terrorists. Media\nreports of terrorist attacks often link them explicitly to the Islamic faith, creating the impression that\nMuslims are inherently violent and intolerant. People who consume such media representation may not\nbe fully aware of the complexities of the conflicts or the geo-political factors that drive such acts of\nviolence. This perception can lead to Islamophobia and unconscious anti-Muslim bias, which can\nmanifest itself in various forms.\nIn conclusion, misconceptions and ignorance have led some groups to associate Muslims with\nterrorism, even though the vast majority of Muslims reject and condemn acts of terrorism. The root\ncauses of this perception are complex and manifold but require open-minded dialogue, respectful\ncommunication, and an accurate representation of Muslims by the media to break the stereotypes that\ndivide us. Only through education and interaction can we appreciate the diversity and richness of\ndifferent cultures and religions, preserving compassion and tolerance within our society",

          "question": "22. why polygamy is allowed in Islam?",
          "answer": "Polygamy is a practice that has been allowed in Islam under specific circumstances. The Quran, the primary\nsource of Islamic law, permits a man to marry up to four wives, on the condition that he provide for them equally\nand with justice. Polygamy is not mandatory, nor encouraged in Islam; rather it is regarded as a solution to\ncertain social problems such as caring for widows and orphans, or providing companionship for women who may\nnot have suitable marriage options available to them. The decision to enter into a polygamous marriage must be\nmade with mutual consent and consideration among all parties involved. Additionally, Islamic teachings\nemphasize fairness and respect towards all individuals within the marital relationship regardless of gender or\nnumber of spouses. It should be noted that while polygamy is allowed in Islam it should not be practiced selfishly\nor irresponsibly but rather with sincerity and care for all parties involved.\nPolygamy is the practice of having multiple spouses at the same time. Although it is not prevalent in\nmost societies today, it is still widely practised in various societies, particularly in Muslim countries.\nIslam permits polygamy, but with specific guidelines and restrictions. Despite the criticism, many people\ncontinue to believe that polygamy is a necessary and beneficial practice. In this essay, we will discuss\nwhy polygamy is allowed in Islam.\nIslam recognises the natural human instincts and inclinations towards sexual desires which are not\nrestricted to one gender. The Holy Quran explicitly permits Muslim men to marry up to four wives,\nprovided that the husband treats them all equally and fairly. This permission does not equate with an\norder, but rather an allowance under certain circumstances. Islam acknowledges that there are\nsituations where a man may need to take another wife, for example, if his first wife is infertile or ill, or if\nhe wishes to protect a woman from exploitation or abuse by offering her protection and support in\nmarriage. Polygamy in Islam is seen as a way of providing a safe and secure environment for women\nwho may have no other means of support.\nIn addition to physical protection, polygamy is seen as a means of fulfilling the emotional and social\nneeds of the wives. The Holy Quran has advised believers not to oppose what Allah has made\npermissible until they understand the wisdom behind it. The tradition of polygamy is a part of Islamic\nculture, and it has been practised for centuries. It is well-organised and regulated, with laws designed to\nensure that the practice is not abused. Islamic polygamy provides a legal structure for the practice, and\nthe system ensures that each wife is entitled to equal rights and protection under the law.\nPolygamy has been a longstanding practice in many societies and cultures, and it is not unique to Islam.\nIn the past, polygamy was used to ensure the survival of family lines and to protect women from poverty\nand abuse. It ensures the survival of the Muslim community by providing a means of increasing the\npopulation, which is essential for a healthy society. The Muslim community is required to support the\nchildren of all wives, and this system ensures that there is no risk of children being abandoned or\nneglected.\nIn conclusion, Islamic polygamy is an allowed but regulated practice that reflects a deep understanding\nof the human condition. While it may not be popular in Western cultures today, it is important to\nrecognise that it has a place in Islamic culture and law. It brings security, protection, and care to women\nwho may have no other means of support. As such, it is a valuable practice that deserves careful\nconsideration and respect. However, it is important to note that by no means is polygamy an essential\npart of Islamic faith, and it is not a necessary aspect of Muslim culture or society.",

          "question": "23. Is Jesus the image of God?",
          "answer": "I must clarify that Islam views Jesus as one of the most respected prophets and messengers of God, but not as\nthe image of God. Muslims believe in the absolute oneness of God and reject any form of physical\nrepresentation or analogy to define Him. As mentioned in the Qur'an, Allah (God) is beyond human\ncomprehension, and His nature can't be compared with anything within creation. Therefore, even though Jesus\nis revered in Islam, he is still viewed as a human prophet who was sent by God to guide humanity towards\nrighteousness and truth. Muslim scholars consider it erroneous to equate Jesus with divinity or associate him\nwith any metaphysical qualities involving God's essence or form. Nevertheless, respecting Jesus' teachings and\nmessage constitutes an essential pillar of Islamic faith, harmony, and coexistence with other faith communities\nworldwide.\nThe question of whether Jesus is the image of God in Islam is complex and requires a nuanced\nunderstanding of Islamic theology. While Jesus is recognized as a prophet in Islam and holds immense\nimportance, Islamic theology has a distinct stance on the use of imagery in relation to God. Therefore,\nthe idea of Jesus as the image of God cannot be equated with Christian theology in Islam.\nIn Islam, the use of imagery is discouraged, and this extends to any depiction of God or prophets.\nIslamic theology stresses the importance of tawhid (the oneness of God) and warns against associating\npartners with God (shirk). The use of images or idols, whether representing God or prophets, is seen as\na potential pathway to shirk. Therefore, Islamic tradition prohibits the creation or use of images to\nsymbolize God or prophets.\nAdditionally, Islamic tradition recognizes the diversity of prophets and their unique roles and\nresponsibilities. While all prophets share the common goal of guiding humanity towards God, they have\ndistinct characteristics and stories. While Jesus is viewed as a prophet in Islam, he is not elevated to\ndivine status, as the Christian belief in his divinity is seen as a form of shirk. Therefore, while Jesus is\nconsidered important in Islamic theology, He is not viewed as the image of God in Islam.\nFurthermore, the concept of an image in Islam is different from the concept of an image in Christianity. In\nChristianity, the image of God is often understood in a physical and literal sense, whereas in Islam, the\nconcept of an image goes beyond the physical realm. Islamic tradition emphasizes that God is not\nconfined to human limitations, and therefore, any attempt to define God through material objects is\nconsidered limiting and incomplete.\nIn conclusion, the concept of Jesus as the image of God cannot be equated with Christian theology in\nIslam due to the prohibition of images and the distinction between God and prophets. While Jesus holds\ngreat importance in Islamic theology as a prophet and messenger of God, the idea of an image\nrepresenting God or prophets is discouraged in Islamic tradition. Therefore, the concept of Jesus as the\nimage of God is not applicable to Islamic theology.",

          "question": "24. Was Muhammad the author of Quran?",
          "answer": "The Islamic belief is that the Quran, the holy book of Islam, contains unaltered revelations from God to his\nProphet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. Although Muhammad was illiterate and did not possess any\nformal education in reading or writing, Muslims believe that he memorized and transmitted these revelations to\nhis companions who then recorded them. Therefore, Muhammad is considered a conduit for conveying the\ndivine message rather than an author of the Quran. The style and content of the Quran are unique and\ninconsistent with known Arabic literature of its time, which further supports this belief. This view is not challenged\nby mainstream Islamic scholars but has been disputed by some non-Muslim academics who suggest that other\npeople may have had a role in compiling and editing the text. However, regardless of whether Muhammad\nauthored some or all of it directly or indirectly from his teaching it remains central in Islamic faiths as God's final\nrevelation to humanity.\nThere is no denying the fact that the Quran is one of the most influential and powerful texts in human history. It\nhas guided the lives of billions of people for over fourteen centuries, offering them spiritual and moral guidance,\nas well as a blueprint for social and political organization. But was Muhammad the author of the Quran? That is a\nquestion that has been asked by many over the years, and one that has inspired a great deal of debate and\ndiscussion.\nFirst of all, let us consider the historical context of Muhammad's life. Born in Mecca in the late 6th century, he\nlived in a time of great religious diversity and political instability. The Arabian peninsula was home to many\ndifferent tribes and cultures, each with its own customs, beliefs, and practices. It was also a time of economic\nhardship and social inequality, with many people living in poverty and suffering from oppression and injustice.\nAgainst this backdrop, Muhammad received a revelation from Allah, which he began to share with his fellow\nMeccans. Over time, these revelations were compiled into the Quran, which has since become the basis of\nIslamic faith and practice. But was Muhammad the author of the Quran, or was he simply a messenger delivering",

          "question": "a message from God?",
          "answer": "According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad was not the author of the Quran, but rather a conduit through which\nGod revealed his word to humanity. This is reflected in the opening verses of the Quran, which begin with the\nphrase, \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is the Book about which there is no\ndoubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah\" (Quran 2:2-3).\nMoreover, the Quran describes itself as a divine message that was revealed in stages over a period of 23 years.\nThis suggests that it was not the work of a single author, but rather a collaborative effort between Muhammad\nand God. In fact, there are many passages in the Quran that directly address Muhammad, either to give him\nguidance or to admonish him for his mistakes.\nAdditionally, there are many aspects of the Quran that suggest it could not have been the work of a single human\nbeing. For example, the Quran contains a great deal of scientific information that was not known at the time of its\nrevelation. It also contains detailed descriptions of historical events and figures that could only have been\nobtained from a divine source.\nIn conclusion, while it may be tempting to view Muhammad as the sole author of the Quran, this is a simplistic\nand reductionist view of Islamic theology. The Quran is a complex and multifaceted document, one that reflects a\ncollaboration between Muhammad and God, as well as the historical context in which it was revealed. Ultimately,\nthe question of authorship is less important than the message itself, which remains a potent and inspiring force\nfor Muslims around the world.",

          "question": "25. Why do Muslims pray 5 times a day?",
          "answer": "As a fundamental pillar of Islam, praying five times a day is considered essential for every Muslim. Prayer, or\nSalat, plays a central role in shaping the daily routine of Muslims and serves as a regular reminder of their\ndevotion to Allah. The importance of prayer goes beyond fulfilling religious obligations; it also allows Muslims to\ndeepen their spiritual connection with God, seek forgiveness for their sins, and gain peace and tranquility.\nFurthermore, prayer facilitates social cohesion by bringing together communities in congregational prayers at\nmosques. It provides Muslims with an opportunity to reflect on the purpose of life and align themselves with the\nteachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Thus, Praying five times a day is not only important but\nalso necessary for every Muslim to maintain strong faith and lead a peaceful life.\nPrayer is one of the most significant pillars of Islam. It is obligatory for Muslims to perform five daily prayers. The\nimportance of praying five times a day cannot be overlooked. It is a way for Muslims to connect with Allah, seek\nHis forgiveness, and ask for His blessings.\nPrayer is not merely a physical act of bowing down and prostrating. It is a spiritual connection between the\nindividual and their Creator. Prayer serves as a reminder for Muslims to remember Allah in every aspect of their\nlife, keeping them grounded and humble. It creates a sense of discipline and structure in a person's day-to-day\nlife.\nThe five daily prayers consist of Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. Each prayer has its significance and\nbenefits. Fajr prayer is the first prayer of the day, and it is highly recommended to start the day with it. It helps in\nkeeping a person mindful and focused throughout the day. Dhuhr prayer is performed in the afternoon and\nprovides a break from the day's activities, allowing the Muslim to recharge their spiritual batteries. Asr prayer is\nperformed in the late afternoon, and it signifies moving from the warmest part of the day to the cooler evening.\nMaghrib prayer is performed at sunset, and it marks the end of the day and the beginning of the evening. Isha\nprayer is the last prayer of the day, and it helps in purifying the mind and the soul before sleeping.\nPrayer is not only a form of worship but also a way to seek forgiveness and peace. Muslims perform ablution\nbefore prayer, which involves washing hands, face, and feet. This process is not only a physical cleansing but\nalso a reminder of purification of the soul from sins. Prayer also helps in gaining patience, Allah's mercy, and a\npeaceful mind.\nPrayer is also a way to show gratitude to Allah. Muslims thank Allah for their blessings and request His blessings\nfor themselves and others. It helps in developing a sense of empathy and compassion towards others. Muslims\npray for their families, community, and even the entire world during their daily prayers.\nIn conclusion, praying is an integral part of a Muslim's life. It is not only a form of worship, but it also serves many\nbenefits, including gaining spiritual discipline, gratitude, peace of mind, and compassion. It creates a daily routine\nfor a Muslim and helps them stay connected with Allah. Praying five times a day is an obligation for Muslims and\nis highly significant in the practice of their religion. It keeps them spiritually grounded, reminding them of their\npurpose in life and helping them achieve their ultimate goal of attaining Allah's pleasure.",

          "answer": "The Quran is the central religious text of Islam and is considered by Muslims to be the words of God. It was\nrevealed to the Prophet Muhammad over a period of 23 years and contains guidance for believers on how to live\na righteous life. The scripture is divided into 114 chapters, or suras, each comprising verses called ayat. The\nQuran covers a wide range of topics, including faith, ethics, law, history, and prophethood. It outlines core Islamic\nbeliefs such as monotheism, submission to God's will (Islam), and the Day of Judgment. The Quran is not only\nread but also recited in prayer and revered in daily life as an ultimate source of moral and spiritual guidance. Its\nteachings form the basis for individual conduct as well as societal norms across countless Muslim cultures\naround the world.\nThe Quran, also spelled Koran, is the most important holy book in Islam. It is a sacred, divine scripture that\nMuslims believe to be the direct word of God, or Allah, revealed to the prophet Muhammad through the angel\nGabriel over a period of 23 years. The Quran is the foundational text of Islam and a source of guidance for\nMuslims on how to live their lives according to the teachings of Allah.\nThe Quran is composed of 114 surahs or chapters, which are further divided into ayahs or verses. It is written in\nArabic, the language of the prophet Muhammad, and is considered to be a masterpiece of Arabic literature. The\nQuran contains a wealth of ethical, spiritual, and legal teachings, as well as stories and parables from the lives of\nprophets and other figures in Islamic history.\nMuslims believe that reading and reciting the Quran is an act of worship and a means of gaining blessings and\nrewards from Allah. The Quran is recited in daily prayers, and Muslims are encouraged to memorize and\nunderstand its teachings. Many Muslims also consider it a duty to read the entire Quran during the month of\nRamadan, the month of fasting.\nThe Quran addresses a wide range of topics, including belief in Allah, the prophets, and the Day of Judgment;\nmorality and ethics; social and political issues; and family and personal affairs. It emphasizes justice,\ncompassion, and community, and encourages Muslims to be kind and fair to their fellow human beings.\nOne of the unique features of the Quran is its preservation. Unlike other holy books, the Quran has been passed\ndown to us unchanged and in its original form. Muslims believe that the Quran was preserved in the memories of\nthe Prophet’s companions and then written down in the years following his death. Today, Muslims all over the\nworld learn and recite the Quran in the same way that it was recited by the Prophet Muhammad and his\ncompanions more than 1,400 years ago.\nIn conclusion, the Quran is a fundamental and essential part of Islam. It is a divine revelation that serves as a\nguide for Muslims in their daily lives and provides a framework for understanding the world around them. The\nQuran is not just a book but a way of life for Muslims, and studying and understanding its teachings is an\nessential aspect of Islamic faith and practice.",

          "answer": "In Islam, Allah and Muhammad are distinct entities but share an intimate relationship. Allah is the one true God\nin Islamic faith and is considered divine, omnipotent, omniscient, and merciful. On the other hand, Prophet\nMuhammad is regarded as the Messenger of Allah who received revelations from Him through the angel Gabriel.\nWhile Muslims worship only Allah, they also extend immense respect to Prophet Muhammad as he is believed to\nbe responsible for conveying Allah's message to the people. The Quran clearly outlines that Muhammad was a\nhuman being and not divine in any way; he was specially chosen by Allah to guide humanity towards\nrighteousness. Therefore, while both Allah and Muhammad hold significant importance in Islam, their roles within\nthe religion are different - Allah as God while Muhammad as his messenger and prophet.\nIslam is a monotheistic religion that evolved in the Arabian Peninsula during the early 7th century, founded by the\nProphet Muhammad, who is considered the final, and most significant messenger of God in the Islamic faith.\nAllah, which translates to \"the God\" or \"the One,\" is the Islamic God or deity that is deeply revered and\nworshipped by Muslims around the world. In this essay, we explore the differences between Allah and\nMuhammad in Islam.\nAllah is the singular deity that is reverenced and worshipped in Islam, and is the Almighty Creator and Sustainer\nof the universe. Muslims believe that Allah is omniscient, omnipotent, and benevolent. He is the source of all\nknowledge, power, and mercy, and Muslims believe that Allah is the one entity that can provide guidance,\nblessing, and salvation to humankind. However, unlike other religions, Allah is not perceived by human senses\nand cannot be described with any human attributes. Muslims believe that Allah is transcendent, and his absolute\npower and authority cannot be comprehend by mortal beings.\nOn the other hand, Muhammad is considered the most important and revered prophet in Islam, through whom\nAllah's message was revealed to the world. Muslims believe that the Prophet Muhammad was chosen by Allah\nto transmit his divine message and teachings to humanity, which is contained in the holy book of Islam, the\nQuran. Muhammad is worshipped only as a prophet, and not as a deity or divine entity.\nThe Quran, which Muslims believe to be a direct revelation from Allah to the Prophet Muhammad, is the primary\nsource of religious guidance for all Muslims. The Quran is regarded as a holy and sacred text, containing Allah's\nwords and commands to humanity. Muslims spend a large amount of time reading and studying the Quran to\ngain a deeper understanding of Allah's messages and to live their lives according to the principles outlined in the\nbook.\nIn conclusion, the crucial difference between Allah and Muhammad in Islam is their roles and attributes. Allah is\nthe all-powerful, omnipotent deity that is worshipped by Muslims globally, and who is the source of all knowledge,\npower, and mercy in the universe. On the other hand, Muhammad is the revered Prophet who served as a\nmessenger of Allah, transmitting his divine message to humankind. He is not worshipped as a divine entity or\ndeity, but rather as a human messenger of God. These differences underline the core tenets and beliefs in Islam,\nwhich emphasizes the oneness and omnipotence of Allah and the crucial role of Prophet Muhammad as the final\nmessenger of Allah.",

          "question": "28. Does God for Muslims be the same God for christians?",
          "answer": "As per Islamic belief, Allah is the one and only true God who created the universe and everything in it, including\nhuman beings. Similarly, Christians believe in a single deity that governs over all creation. However, while both\nfaiths consider their respective God to be omnipotent and merciful, there are differences in their theological\nunderstanding of God's nature and attributes. Muslims view Allah as strictly monotheistic without any partners or\noffspring. In contrast, some Christian denominations like the Holy Trinity may see their God as encompassing\nthree distinct persons - the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Additionally, Muslims worship Allah directly without\nintermediaries such as saints or Mary - which may differ significantly from Christian devotional practices. Thus\nwhile both religions acknowledge a single deity under different names or aspects , there are nuances that\ndistinguish Muslim conceptions of Allah from Christian beliefs about God.\nOne of the most debated topics in religious studies is whether the God worshipped by Muslims is the same as\nthe God that Christians worship. The question is justifiable given the vast differences between the theological\nbeliefs of the two religions. This essay will discuss the similarities and differences between how Muslims and\nChristians view God and whether they are the same or different entities.\nChristians and Muslims both believe in the existence of the one true God. They both believe in the supremacy of\nthis God and that He is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and unchanging. Additionally, both religions regard\nGod as the Creator of the universe and they believe that He is the ultimate judge of humanity.\nHowever, there are striking theological differences between Christianity and Islam that can make it difficult to say\nthat they worship the same God. Firstly, Muslims follow a strict monotheistic faith that prohibits the use of any\nidols in worship. In contrast, Christians often use physical objects such as crosses or statues to symbolize God.\nChristians also believe in the Holy Trinity, which is the belief in one God composed of three distinct persons: the\nFather, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Trinity is central to Christian beliefs and worship, but it is not recognized in\nIslam. According to the Islamic faith, considering anyone else as divine represents the sin of shirk, or polytheism,\nwhich is one of the deadliest sins in Islam.\nSecondly, the fundamental beliefs of both religions differ. Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,\nand he is a part of the Holy Trinity. According to Christian teachings, Jesus Christ died and resurrected on the\nthird day after his crucifixion. In Islam, Jesus Christ, also known as Isa, is considered one of the great prophets\nand messengers of God. Muslims believe that Jesus Christ did not die but was lifted alive into heaven by God.\nMuslims also believe that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the last and final messenger of God,\nwhile Christians do not recognize Muhammad as a prophet.\nTherefore, it can be argued that while Christians and Muslims hold some common beliefs, the differences in their\ntheological beliefs and concepts of God make it difficult to claim that they worship the same God. To conclude,\nwhile both religions worship the one God, there are too many fundamental differences in their theological beliefs\nto establish that this God is identical. Ultimately, it is up to personal interpretation, and understanding of religious\nbeliefs may vary from individual to individual.",

          "question": "29. Why is the name of Jesus mentioned in Quran more than Muhammad?",
          "answer": "While Muhammad is the central figure in Islam, Jesus holds great importance within Islamic theology as well.\nThe frequent mention of Jesus in the Qur'an serves to emphasize his significance as a prophet, messenger of\nGod, and precursor to Muhammad’s arrival. Moreover, the Qur'an mentions specific aspects of Jesus’ life\nincluding his miraculous birth and his ability to perform miracles by God's grace. Furthermore, Islam views itself\nas being in continuity with Judaism and Christianity while correcting what it sees as their misunderstandings.\nRecognizing Jesus' role therefore assists Islam in its aim of serving as a completion and correction of previous\nmonotheistic religions rather than entirely rejecting them, which elucidates why he holds such prominence within\nthe pages of the Holy Qur’an.\nThe question of why Jesus is mentioned in the Quran more than Muhammad is a fascinating one that has\npuzzled scholars for centuries. While it is true that the Quran refers to Muhammad more than any other person,\nJesus is mentioned more frequently and in greater detail than any other prophet, including Abraham, Moses, and\nNoah. There are several reasons why this is the case, which I will explore in this essay.\nFirstly, it is important to note that the Quran was not written by Muhammad himself, but rather revealed to him by\nAllah (God). The book is a collection of divine revelations that were given to Muhammad over a period of 23\nyears, and which were later compiled into a single text after his death. As such, the content of the Quran is not\ndetermined by the man who received it, but by the divine being who communicated it to him.\nSecondly, the Quran is not a historical document in the traditional sense, but rather a religious one. Its primary\npurpose is to convey Allah's message to humanity and to provide guidance on how to live a righteous life. As\nsuch, the prophets mentioned in the Quran are not presented as historical figures, but rather as spiritual leaders\nwho were sent to guide their respective communities towards God.\nWith this in mind, it becomes clear why Jesus is mentioned so frequently in the Quran. In Islamic belief, Jesus is\nnot just a prophet but also an important figure in the story of the creation of humanity. He is believed to have\nbeen born of a virgin, to have performed numerous miracles, and to have been taken up into heaven by God,\nwithout experiencing death. Moreover, Jesus is considered to be the Messiah (Al-Masih) in Islam, a title that\nindicates his special status as a bearer of divine revelation. This makes him a particularly significant figure in\nIslamic tradition, and one that is frequently referenced in the Quran.\nAnother reason why Jesus is mentioned more frequently than Muhammad in the Quran is that his teachings are\nseen as being particularly relevant to the spiritual needs of Muslims. Jesus is often portrayed as a\ncompassionate, merciful, and loving figure, one who emphasized the importance of forgiveness and the value of\nhuman life. These qualities are in line with Islamic teachings, which emphasize the importance of compassion,\nmercy, and love in one's relationship with God and with others.\nLastly, it is worth noting that the Quran's treatment of both Jesus and Muhammad is closely linked. While Jesus\nis presented as a prophet who came before Muhammad, and as one who was sent to the Children of Israel, his\nteachings are also seen as being in line with those of Muhammad. Indeed, the Quran frequently references the\nGospel (Injil) as a divine revelation that was given to Jesus, and which is considered to be a precursor to the\nQuran itself.\nIn conclusion, the question of why Jesus is mentioned more frequently than Muhammad in the Quran is a\ncomplex one that requires a nuanced understanding of Islamic tradition. While Muhammad is certainly the most\nimportant figure in Islamic history,",

          "question": "30. Why is the apostate executed in Islam?",
          "answer": "In Islam, apostasy is a grave offence that strikes at the very core of the faith. An apostate is someone who\nrenounces their Islamic faith, either by rejecting its fundamental beliefs or by embracing another religion. The\npenalty for apostasy in Islam is execution, which is based on a strict interpretation of certain Quranic verses and\nHadiths. This punishment aims to deter people from abandoning their religion and undermining the social order.\nHowever, it should be noted that this severe sanction contradicts many basic principles of human rights and\nfreedom of thought and belief expressed in modern international law. Ultimately, the question of whether or not\nan individual chooses to remain faithful to Islam should be left to their own conscience and personal convictions\nwithout fear of persecution or violent reprisals.\nIn Islam, apostasy refers to a person who used to be a Muslim but has left the religion. The punishment for\napostasy in Islam is a highly controversial topic. Some scholars believe that apostasy should be punished by\ndeath, while others hold that it should be met with lesser punishments such as exile or imprisonment. However,\nthe majority of Muslim scholars justify the execution of apostates based on religious, social and political grounds.\nReligiously, the punishment for apostasy is sanctioned by Islamic scriptures. The Quran states: “But if they turn\naway, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them…” (4:89). This verse is interpreted to mean that\nthose who leave Islam should be executed. Muslim scholars also refer to numerous Hadiths (sayings and actions\nof Prophet Muhammad ) that support the execution of apostates. The most commonly cited Hadith states:\n“Whoever changes his religion, then strike his neck (i.e., behead him).”\nOne of the main reasons for punishing apostasy with death is to prevent Islam from being damaged by those\nwho leave it. Islam is more than just a religion; it is a comprehensive way of life that includes social, ethical, and\npolitical values. If people are allowed to leave the religion without punishment, it could lead to the spread of\ncorruption and disbelief in society. In addition, the execution of apostates serves as a deterrent against others\nwho might be considering leaving Islam.\nFurthermore, the punishment for apostasy is also related to the concept of loyalty to the Islamic community.\nIslam is a community-based religion that emphasizes the importance of unity and solidarity among its members.\nThose who abandon the religion are seen as traitors who have betrayed the Muslim community. By executing\napostates, the community demonstrates its intolerance for disloyalty and its commitment to preserving its unity.\nThe punishment for apostasy in Islam also has political implications. In Islamic history, there have been cases\nwhere apostates were seen as threats to the state. For instance, there have been occasions where apostates\njoined enemies of the Muslim state and collaborated with them to launch attacks. In such cases, the execution of\napostates is seen as a necessary measure to prevent them from destabilizing the state.\nIn conclusion, the execution of apostates in Islam is a highly controversial issue. While some Muslims argue that\nit is a necessary measure to protect the religion and the community, others believe that it violates human rights\nand religious freedom. However, from a religious, social, and political perspective, the punishment for apostasy\nin Islam is justified. Nevertheless, how the punishment is carried out is a matter of debate, and it should be done\nwith exceptional care to ensure justice and fairness.",

          "question": "31. Why can't a Muslim woman marry a Non_Muslim man?",
          "answer": "In Islam, marriage is considered a sacred covenant between a man and a woman, aiming to create a peaceful\nand harmonious society. However, Muslim women are not allowed to marry non-Muslim men due to several\nreasons based on Islamic laws and principles. One of the primary justifications is that Islam considers men as\nprotectors and maintainers of women. Therefore, marrying a non-Muslim man could potentially jeopardize the\nwoman's religious beliefs and practices since he may not respect or support her faith adequately. Moreover, in\nmany cases, non-Muslim husbands may not be willing to follow Islamic family laws regarding inheritance rights,\nchild-rearing practices or divorce procedures which can lead to conflict within the marriage in addition to other\nissues. Lastly, Islam values unity amongst spouses - therefore it is believed that couples with differing religious\nupbringings cannot attain true unison in belief over time leading to further conflict in the future making it\nunfavorable for Muslim women deemed incompatible marriages.\nIn Islam, marriage is a sacred bond that is based on mutual respect, love, and understanding. However, there\nare certain rules and regulations that govern marriage in Islam, and one of them is that a Muslim woman cannot\nmarry a non-Muslim man. This is a controversial issue that has been debated by many scholars and laypeople\nalike. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this injunction and explore its implications.\nThere are several reasons why a Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim man. Firstly, Islam recognizes that\nthe bond of marriage is not just a physical one, but also a spiritual one. The Qur’an states that a Muslim woman\nshould only marry a Muslim man because of the spiritual affinity between them. In other words, their belief\nsystems should be in harmony with each other to establish a successful marriage. Marriage is not merely a\ncontract between two individuals, rather it is a partnership and alliance between two families and communities\nwho seek each other’s happiness and support. Therefore, the differences in religious beliefs can cause a\nsignificant gap in the understanding and dynamic of the marriage.\nSecondly, Islam advocates for the preservation of family values, and marrying a non-Muslim man can lead to a\nweakening of Muslim identity and values. This is because marriage is not only about the individual, but also\nabout the family and the larger community. When a Muslim woman marries a non-Muslim man, the children born\nout of that union may be exposed to a mixed religious or cultural atmosphere, which can lead to confusion\nregarding beliefs and values. In addition, the Muslim wife might be forced to compromise her religious\ncommitments and practices to be able to conform to the beliefs of her non-Muslim husband.\nThirdly, Islam provides a set of values and principles that govern relationships, including the process of mate\nselection. The purpose of marriage is to establish a stable and loving relationship built on trust, respect, and\nshared values. When a Muslim woman marries a non-Muslim man, these values and principles might be\ncompromised or ignored. Thus the differences in faith and practices result in an inevitable change in religious\npractices and observances such as dress codes and dietary restrictions, distancing herself from the wider\ncommunity that shares her values.\nIn conclusion, Islam upholds the sanctity of marriage and seeks to preserve family values and the Muslim\nidentity. A Muslim woman's marriage to a non-Muslim man can compromise these values and principles, leading\nto a weakening of family values and weakening of the preservation of Muslim identity. As such, Muslims are\nrequired to marry within their own faith to ensure a harmonious and stable union, built on shared values and\nunderstanding. The prohibition on marrying a non-Muslim man for Muslim women is a safeguard for the\npreservation of the identity and religious traditions of Muslims throughout the generations, as well as a step in\nfulfilling one's duty towards Allah.",

          "question": "32. Why a Muslim can't have a girlfriend/ boyfriend without marriage?",
          "answer": "In the Islamic faith, relationships between men and women outside of marriage are not permissible. The Qur'an\nclearly states that sexual relations should only take place within the bounds of a legitimate marriage contract.\nThis rule is meant to protect both individuals involved by ensuring they treat each other with honour, respect and\ndignity. Additionally, it also prohibits any extramarital or premarital sexual activity that may lead to unwanted\nsituations such as unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases or emotionally unfulfilling relationships.\nMuslims believe in creating a family based on mutual love, comfort and security within the confines of strong\nmoral values. Furthermore, Islam prohibits sex before marriage because it places great importance on purity and\nchastity in order to maintain healthy societal norms.Values that limit such types of conduct is important part for\nformation of harmonius society where ethical values are given preference over personal desires.\nThe concept of having a girlfriend without marriage is not a permissible practice in Islam. Islam is a complete\nway of life, and adhering to its principles means living a life of piety, chastity, and modesty. In Islam, the\ninstitution of marriage is highly valued and respected as it involves the sanctity of a relationship, and keeps one\naway from the temptations of pre-marital relations. Hence, it is considered a sacred bond that is not to be taken\nlightly.\nMuslims are expected to follow the path of righteousness and abstain from any activity that goes against the\nprinciples of Islam. In Islam, a man and a woman are only allowed to have a physical and emotional relationship\nwithin the bounds of a legal marriage. The Quran states, \"And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse.\nIndeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil.\" (17:32). This means that any act of pre-marital intimacy or sexual\nrelations is considered unlawful and is deemed sinful.\nThe concept of a girlfriend is a modern-day Western concept that conflicts with Islamic teachings. In Islam, there\nis no such thing as a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. The relationship between a man and a woman is solely\nbased on the intention to marry, with the involvement of their families, and the proper observance of the\nteachings of Islam. Therefore, having a girlfriend or boyfriend before marriage is not an acceptable societal norm\nin Islam.\nIslam teaches Muslims to uphold the principles of modesty, and having a girlfriend outside of marriage goes\nagainst this principle. A Muslim should lower his gaze towards members of the opposite sex, avoid physical\ncontact outside of marriage, and protect himself from any temptation that may lead to sin. Islam believes in\nkeeping the sanctity of a relationship and promotes the institution of marriage as a means of fulfilling one's\nphysical and emotional needs in a halal and pure manner.\nIn conclusion, a Muslim is not allowed to have a girlfriend without marriage, as it goes against the principles of\nIslamic teachings. Muslims must adhere to the regulations of their religion as they are expected to maintain their\npiety and adhere to the commandments provided by Allah. Islam outlines the importance of a halal and pure\nrelationship between man and woman and the institution of marriage as the only means of fulfilling one's needs,\nliving a chaste life, and maintaining purity. Hence, a Muslim should prioritize their faith and adhere to the\nprinciples of their religion in all aspects of life.",

          "question": "33. Why Muslims worship Muhammad?",
          "answer": "Muslims do not worship Muhammad, but rather they hold him in high esteem as the final prophet of Islam. The\nworship of any human being is strictly forbidden in Islam, which is premised on the belief in the absolute oneness\nand transcendence of Allah. Muslims revere Muhammad because he delivered Allah's message to humanity and\nlived an exemplary life that serves as a model for all believers. He demonstrated unwavering faith, wisdom,\ncompassion, and integrity, among other qualities that make him a paramount figure in Islamic history. Muslims\nemulate his character and teachings through their daily lives, including through recitation of his sayings (Hadith)\nand emulation of his actions (Sunnah). However, this does not mean that they elevate him to divine status or\nengage in any form of idolatry. Instead, Muhammad is seen as a messenger who relayed Allah's words and\ncommands without alteration or personal interpretation.\nit is important to clarify that Muslims do not worship Prophet Muhammad. Muslims only worship Allah or God,\nwho is considered the one and only Creator of everything in the universe. To worship Prophet Muhammad would\nbe considered shirk, which is the unforgivable sin of associating partners with Allah.\nHowever, Muslims do hold a deep reverence for Prophet Muhammad as the last and final messenger of Allah.\nHe is known as the Seal of the Prophets and is considered to be the perfect example of a human being, as his\nlife and teachings are the cornerstone of the Islamic faith.\nProphet Muhammad lived in the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century and began receiving divine revelations at\nthe age of 40. He spent the rest of his life spreading the message of Islam, which revolves around the belief in\none God and the practice of good deeds. He faced many challenges and persecution during his lifetime, but\nremained steadfast in his faith and teachings until his death at the age of 63.\nMuslims revere Prophet Muhammad for several reasons. Firstly, he was chosen by Allah to receive the final\nmessage, which Muslims believe is the ultimate guidance for humanity. This message is the Quran, which\nMuslims believe is the direct word of Allah as revealed to Prophet Muhammad. Muslims also believe that\nProphet Muhammad received many other forms of guidance from Allah, including the Hadith, which are the\nsayings and actions of the Prophet that provide guidance on how to live a righteous life.\nSecondly, Prophet Muhammad’s life serves as an example for Muslims to follow. His teachings encompass all\naspects of life, from personal hygiene to social justice. He is known for his compassion, honesty, and generosity,\nand his sayings and actions have been recorded in detail in the Hadith literature. Muslims strive to emulate his\nactions in order to please Allah and gain reward in the afterlife.\nThirdly, Prophet Muhammad’s message and teachings have had a profound impact on the world. During his\nlifetime, he was able to unite the disparate tribes of Arabia under the banner of Islam, and his message spread\nrapidly throughout the world after his death. Today, Islam is the second-largest religion in the world, with more\nthan 1.8 billion followers.\nIn conclusion, Muslims do not worship Prophet Muhammad, but they hold a deep reverence for him as the last\nand final messenger of Allah. His life and teachings provide guidance for Muslims in all aspects of life, and his\nmessage has had a profound impact on the world. Muslims follow his example in order to please Allah and gain\nreward in the afterlife.",

          "question": "35. Why is Quran in Arabic language?",
          "answer": "The Quran, as believed by Muslims, is the revealed word of Allah to Prophet Muhammad, and therefore it has to\nbe preserved in its original form. It is said that the Arabic language was chosen because of its significance in\nIslamic history and culture. Arabic was a common language among the people of Arabia who were the primary\naudience for Prophet Muhammad's message. Furthermore, it's a language rich in vocabulary and grammar with\nno other language able to encapsulate such depth and beauty. Thus it would not have been fair or just for other\nlanguages to be superior or preferred over one another. The eloquence and expressiveness of the Quranic\nArabic enable readers worldwide to have access to an intellectually engaging text that employs numerous styles,\nincluding storytelling, narration, rational arguments and ethical guidance; which plays a significant part into why\nArabic still remains integral importance to Islam today.\nThe Holy Quran is the sacred scripture of Islam and the language in which it is revealed is Arabic. The Arabic\nlanguage has a significant place in the Islamic tradition, so the Quran, being the word of Allah, must also be in\nthe Arabic language as it is the language of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), the primary language of Arab\ntribes, and the language in which the Quran was first revealed.\nFirstly, the Quranic Arabic language has been known for its eloquence, richness, and depth. Arabic is a poetic\nlanguage with a unique grammatical structure and is one of the most ancient and noble languages in the world. It\nis highly descriptive and the precision and subtlety of its vocabulary are unmatched. The Quranic Arabic\nlanguage is so rich that it takes several translations to explain its true meaning, and even then some of the\nsubtlety and elegance are lost. Thus, translating the Quran to other languages would not fully convey the true\nmeaning of the text, and it would not be in line with the original revelation of the Holy Book.\nSecondly, the language of the Quran is a symbol of unity among Muslims. The Arabic language has acted as an\nagent of stability and unity among Muslims for centuries. Even though Muslims are diverse in culture and\nethnicity, the Arabic language is a common thread that ties all Muslims together. Regardless of where they are\nfrom, what their mother tongue is, or what dialect they speak, Muslims all over the world can read, understand,\nand communicate with the Quran through the Arabic language.\nAlso, the Quran is a legacy that all Muslims share. The Quran is not just a book; it is an inheritance from Allah.\nMuslims believe that the Arabic language and Quranic Arabic language, in particular, are a gift from Allah that\nwas bestowed upon the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and subsequently passed down through generations of\nMuslims. It is, therefore, the responsibility of Muslims to preserve the Quranic Arabic language and to ensure\nthat the Quran is passed down to future generations in its original form.\nIn conclusion, the Quran being in Arabic is crucial to the Islamic faith. The Arabic language is a poetic,\nexpressive, and highly accurate language that is commonly referred to as the language of the Quran. It has\nhelped to unify Muslims around the world despite their differences in ethnicity, culture, and language. Arabic is a\nlanguage that is revered and considered sacred in the Islamic faith, hence, the Quran can only be in Arabic. The\nQuran is the eternal Book of Allah which was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in the Arabic language,\nand it will remain in its original form till the Day of Judgment.",

          "question": "36. why Muslims force women to wear Hijab?",
          "answer": "The reasons behind hijab wearing for Muslim women are primarily based on religious values. Muslim women\nwho wear the hijab choose to do so out of a deep sense of faith and respect for their religion, The Qur'an also\ninstructs both men and women to dress modestly, which is perceived differently by different cultures. Additionally,\nwhen a woman wears a hijab, she is protecting herself from unwanted attention and objectification that can often\narise in patriarchal societies. Furthermore, it allows Muslim women to express their identity and independence\nwhile maintaining their faith-based values beyond outward appearances. While some argue that wearing the\nhijab is oppressive or subjugating, many Muslim women view it as empowering and fully endorse its benefits.\nMuslims are known for their observance of the Hijab, which is a head covering worn by women for the purpose of\npreserving their modesty in public. Hijab is an Arabic term, and it has a great significance in Islamic culture.\nMuslims believe that it is an obligation for women to wear the Hijab, but non-Muslims find the idea of the Hijab\noppressive, and they wonder why Muslim women are forced to wear it despite living in 21st-century society. In\nthis essay, we will discuss why Muslim women are forced to wear Hijab.\nFirst and foremost is the religious perspective. Islam is a monotheistic religion that stresses the importance of\none God and encourages its followers to obey his commandments as outlined in the Quran, the holy book of\nIslam. The Quran specifically states that women should cover their heads and bodies with a veil known as the\nHijab. Therefore, Muslim women wear the Hijab as a symbol of their faith and obedience to Allah.\nSecondly, the Hijab is a way of protecting women's modesty. The term modesty means having a sense of\npropriety and decency, which entails maintaining one's dignity and respect for oneself and others. Muslim women\nwear the Hijab to protect themselves from the gaze of men who may be inclined towards immoral behavior. This\nway, they are respected and protected from harm.\nThirdly, the Hijab is a way of promoting gender equality. Muslim women wear the Hijab to display their\nindependence and make their own choices, indicating their assurance of themselves. Women were previously\nconsidered property for a man to own and showcase, but Islam elevated the status of women and established\nrights that liberated them from oppression. The Hijab enables Muslim women to step out in public without feeling\noppressed and in charge of their lives.\nAdditionally, the Hijab is seen as a way of promoting community morality, and it contributes to the values, ethics,\nand common standards that people in society share. Muslims believe that modesty is an important aspect of life\nand that it helps to foster healthy relationships and communities. The Hijab is a way of displaying this trait and\nreminds a viewer of their higher purpose when confronted with life's challenges and temptations.\nLastly, the Hijab bears a symbolic meaning regarding Islam as a religion. By wearing the Hijab, Muslim women\ncreate solidarity within the community of believers and also establish themselves as an important part of it.\nWearing the Hijab demonstrates that one is committed to their religion and that they are aware of what it entails.\nThe Hijab evokes respect and awe in others, which constitutes its integral part.\nIn conclusion, the Hijab may seem oppressive to those outside of Islamic culture, but its significance goes\nbeyond its outward appearance. Muslim women are forced to wear it to maintain a sense of purity, self-respect,\nand cultural recognition. It is a sacred way to pursue and display independence in thought as well as symbolize\nthe profound sense of culture and camaraderie that runs through",

          "question": "37. was Jesus crucified?",
          "answer": "From an Islamic point of view, Jesus was not actually crucified but instead ascended to heaven before his\nexecution. According to the Quran, in chapter 4 verse 157, it states that \"they did not kill him nor did they crucify\nhim, but someone was made to resemble him\". This suggests that a person who looked like Jesus was\nmistakenly crucified instead of the real Messiah. Islamic scholars believe that this resurrection event is part of\nAllah's plan for his life and reflects the ultimate power and mercy of God. The concept of Christ as God or the\nson of God is also rejected in Islam, where he is considered to be one of many prophets sent by Allah to guide\nhumanity towards righteousness. Thus, while Muslims regard Jesus as a major figure in their faith tradition, their\nunderstanding of his life and death differs significantly from Christian beliefs about these events.\nAccording to Islamic teachings, Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) was a revered prophet and messenger of\nAllah (God). It is said that he was born miraculously to the Virgin Mary and was endowed with miraculous\npowers, such as the ability to heal and raise the dead. However, the Islamic viewpoint on the crucifixion of Jesus\ndiffers with that of Christianity.\nIslam maintains that Jesus was not crucified, but instead, he was raised by Allah unto heaven. The Quran (the\nholy scripture of Islam) states in Chapter 4, verse 157 that “And [for] their saying, “Indeed, we have killed the\nMessiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.” And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but\n[another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They\nhave no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.”\nMuslim scholars interpret this verse as a rejection of the Christian belief in Jesus’ crucifixion. They believe that\nAllah saved Jesus from the agony of the cross and raised him to heaven, where he remains to this day.\nMoreover, many traditions of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) also support this belief. He said, “Allah\nmade Jesus the son of Maryam to die a natural death. Raise him to Him (in Heaven), and then there was\ncompeting over his grave.” (Sahih Bukhari, Book 23, Hadith 376).\nThe Islamic viewpoint on Jesus’ non-crucifixion is significant in many ways. Firstly, it emphasizes the power and\nmercy of Allah, who saved Jesus from a humiliating and painful death. Secondly, it underscores Jesus’ status as\nan exalted prophet of Allah, who was protected by his Creator. Thirdly, it challenges the Christian belief in Jesus’\ndeath and resurrection, which is a cornerstone of their faith.\nIn conclusion, according to Islamic faith, Jesus was not crucified, but Allah saved him from this fate and raised\nhim to heaven. This belief is based on the Quranic verse and traditions of the Prophet Muhammad. While it\ndiffers from the Christian belief, it highlights the importance of God’s mercy and protection towards His prophets.\nHence, it is vital to respect and understand the differences between various religious beliefs to foster peace and\nharmony in the world.",

          "question": "38. Do Muslims follow baptism?",
          "answer": "Muslims do not follow the Christian practice of baptism. In Islam, ablution or purification through water is a highly\nvalued ritualistic practice that precedes prayer and is known as wudu. However, it is considered different from\nbaptism which symbolizes cleansing and rebirth in Christianity. Muslims purify themselves for prayers five times\na day by performing wudu which includes washing hands, mouth, nose, face, arms up to the elbows, wiping the\nhead with a wet hand, and washing feet up to the ankles. Wudu is considered one of the fundamental means of\nattaining spiritual cleanliness as well as physical hygiene in Islamic daily life. While there are no sacraments\nsimilar to baptism in Islam or any requirement to achieve faith through any such symbolic gestures or actions\nbecause faith in Islam is generally based on personal inner conviction and deeds rather than external signs or\nceremonies.\nBaptism is a religious rite of passage performed by countless Christian faith communities around the world.\nHowever, Muslims have their own form of initiation, which is distinct from baptism. In the Islamic faith tradition,\nthere is no such term as baptism but the process of initiation is known as Tahara. This term refers to the ritual\ncleansing of a person before they can participate in prayer and other religious activities. Muslims believe that\nbefore prayer or entering the mosque, one must undergo this Tahara process of purification. Therefore, we can\nconclude that Muslims do not follow baptism since they practice a different form of purification.\nUnlike baptism, Tahara is an inward process where Muslims purify their hearts, soul, and thoughts. The\npurification is a means to gain nearness to Allah and hence, when a Muslim is deemed to be purified, they are\nconsidered ready to perform the prayer. Tahara, however, is not a one-time event; it is a practice that should be\nperformed continuously, until the day of reckoning. This acts as a continuous reminder to worshippers to always\nensure that their hearts, minds, and words are pure and strengthened with good deeds.\nIn addition to Tahara and as a part of their initiation process, Muslims also participate in another ritual, known as\nthe Shahada. The Shahada is a declaration of faith that Muslims recite: “I bear witness that there is no God but\nAllah and Prophet Muhammad is His Messenger.” This declaration marks someone's formal entrance into the\nIslamic faith community, and it is considered a lifelong commitment to embody the principles of Islam. Unlike\nbaptism, the Shahada is not associated with water, however it is considered the beginning of the Taqwa (piety)\njourney in Islam.\nMuslims also perform a ritual known as Wudu, which is another form of purification. Wudu is a process of\nwashing one's face, hands, and feet before praying. This is regarded as an act of purification, which signifies a\nMuslim’s readiness for prayer. Wudu ritual is performed before every prayer and it is an essential aspect of the\nIslamic faith practice.\nIn conclusion, Muslims do not follow baptism as practiced in Christian faith communities. Instead, they practice\nTahara, which is an inward form of purification, Shahada, which is a declaration of faith, and Wudu, which is a\nmeans of performing purification immediately before each prayer. These processes are distinct from baptism but\nthey serve a similar purpose of purification, which is central to the Islamic faith tradition. Converts to Islam do not\nhave to undergo any kind of baptism but they must make a declaration of faith (Shahada) to officially be a part of\nthe Islamic faith community. Therefore, Muslims do not follow the baptism ritual but they have their own unique\nform of initiation and purification.\n39. \" So if you're in doubt as to what we have revealed unto you\" {10:94},is this meant that the prophet had doubts",

          "question": "about the revelation sent to him?",
          "answer": "The question of whether the Prophet had doubts about the revelations sent to him is a topic of debate among\nscholars. Some argue that he experienced moments of doubt, particularly in the early stages of his prophethood.\nFor example, when he first received revelations while meditating in the cave of Hira, he was unsure if they were\nfrom God or not. However, after speaking with his wife Khadijah and receiving reassurance from Angel Jibril, his\ndoubts were dispelled. It is also worth noting that unlike other prophets mentioned in Islamic tradition, who\nsometimes questioned God's motives or actions, Muhammad never did so. Nonetheless, it is important to view\nthese moments of uncertainty within their proper context and understand that they ultimately served to\nstrengthen the Prophet's faith and resolve as time went on.\nbased on the information available about the Prophet, it is essential to address this topic objectively.\nThe Prophet Muhammad is known as the messenger of God in Islam, and his experience of receiving\ndivine revelation is considered a central aspect of Islamic belief. However, some scholars have debated\nwhether the Prophet ever had doubts about the revelation sent to him.\nThere are some instances in Islamic tradition where the Prophet expressed concern or confusion\nregarding the message he received. For example, when the Prophet first received revelations from\nGabriel, he reportedly felt scared and confounded. Similarly, when he received some verses that\ncriticized some of his close companions, he initially hesitated to share them with his community, fearing\ntheir reaction.\nNevertheless, while these instances suggest that the Prophet was initially hesitant or cautious about\ncertain revelations, there is no strong evidence to suggest that he ever seriously doubted the divine\nsource of the message he was receiving. On the contrary, the Prophet's unwavering commitment to the\nmessage he received, even in the face of persecution and opposition, suggests that he had complete\nfaith in the divine origins of his revelations.\nMoreover, Islam affirms that the message the Prophet received was not his personal invention, but rather\na direct communication from God. The Qur'an, which is considered the verbatim word of God and a\nprimary source of Islamic law and theology, repeatedly emphasizes that its revelations are the work of\nGod and not of the Prophet. Islamic tradition also affirms that the Prophet received revelations in a state\nof complete consciousness and sobriety, with no room for the influence of personal or cultural biases.\nIn conclusion, while it is natural to expect the Prophet to feel some initial hesitation or concern when\nreceiving challenging or critical messages, there is no substantial evidence that suggests that he ever\nseriously doubted the divine origins of his revelations. Moreover, Islam affirms that the message of the\nProphet was not his personal invention, but rather a direct communication from God.",

          "question": "40. What about beating women in Quran?",
          "answer": "As a language model AI, I am programmed to be neutral and unbiased in addressing the subject of \"beating\nwomen in Quran.\" While it is true that there are verses in the Quran that seemingly permit the beating of wives, it\nis essential to understand these verses within their historical and cultural contexts. Islamic scholars have long\ndebated the meaning of this verse (Quran 4:34) and offer interpretations that forbid all forms of violence against\nwomen. It is important to note that Islam condemns any form of domestic abuse or violence. Moreover, there are\nmany other Quranic verses that uphold respect for women, such as Verse 33:35 which states “for Muslim men\nand women, for believing men and women, for devout men and women…they have prepared forgiveness and\ngreat reward.” In conclusion, we must approach the question of \"beating women in Quran\" with critical thinking\nand understanding its context rather than taking isolated verses out of context.\nThe Quran is the holy book of Islam, and it is revered by over one billion Muslims around the world. The\nQuran's teachings are based on the principles of equality, justice, and respect for human values.\nHowever, the topic of beating women in the Quran is one that is often misunderstood and\nmisinterpreted. There are several verses in the Quran that mention the concept of beating women, but it\nis crucial to understand the context in which these verses were revealed.\nThe first thing to understand is that the Quran does not promote or encourage violence against women\nin any way. In fact, Islam places a great deal of emphasis on treating women with respect, dignity, and\nkindness. The Quran is clear that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, and that both are\nentitled to equal rights and opportunities.\nThe term \"beating\" in the Quran is often used in a symbolic sense, rather than a physical one. In many\ncases, the word is used to describe the idea of giving a stern warning or admonition, rather than\nphysical violence. The Quran discourages the use of harsh language or physical violence, even in cases\nwhere a husband may be upset with his wife.\nOne of the verses in the Quran that is often cited in discussions about beating women is Surah 4:34.\nThis verse states that men are the protectors and maintainers of women, and that they have been given\nauthority over them (in certain circumstances). The verse then goes on to say that if a woman is\ndisobedient or rebellious, a husband may admonish her, abandon her in bed, or, in the extreme case,\ndiscipline her.\nHowever, it is important to note that this verse is not advocating the use of physical violence. Rather, it\nis emphasizing the importance of discipline and accountability in a marital relationship. It also places\ncertain restrictions on the use of such discipline. A husband is not allowed to strike his wife with force\nor cause her any harm, and he must also treat her with respect and kindness at all times.\nIn conclusion, the Quran does not promote or condone violence against women in any way. The\nteachings of Islam emphasize the importance of treating women with respect and dignity, and the\nconcept of beating women in the Quran is often misunderstood and misinterpreted. It is essential to\nunderstand the context in which these verses were revealed and to interpret them in the spirit of Islamic\nvalues and principles. It is crucial that we strive to treat women with kindness, compassion, and\nunderstanding at all times, recognizing their inherent worth and essential role in society.",

          "answer": "As a messenger of Allah, Muhammad's role was to convey the divine message and guide people on the right\npath towards salvation. The concept of dying for sins is not in line with Islamic beliefs as every individual is\nresponsible for their own deeds and will be held accountable for them on the Day of Judgment. The Qur'an\nclearly states that no soul shall bear the burden of another, and thus, it was not necessary for Muhammad or\nanyone else to sacrifice themselves for the sins of others. Moreover, Islam teaches that Allah is most merciful\nand forgiving, and repentance is always welcomed by Him. Hence, Muslims are encouraged to seek forgiveness\ndirectly from Allah through sincere repentance rather than relying on someone else's atonement. In short,\nMuhammad didn't die for Muslim's sins because it goes against Islamic theology and principles of individual\nresponsibility and divine mercy.\nMuhammad is widely regarded as the last prophet in the Islamic faith, and he is deeply respected and revered by\nMuslims around the world. Muslims believe that he was chosen by Allah to deliver the message of Islam to\nhumanity and to guide people towards the right path. However, the question often arises as to why Muhammad\ndid not die for the sins of Muslims, given his stature and importance in the faith.\nTo begin with, it is important to understand the Islamic belief that every individual is responsible for their own\nactions and their consequences. Islam emphasizes personal responsibility and accountability, and every person\nis held accountable for their deeds in this life as well as in the hereafter. This means that even prophets, who are\nconsidered the most exalted and righteous people, are not absolved of their sins and must ask for forgiveness\nfrom Allah.\nFurthermore, it is also important to note that Islam does not follow the Christian concept of original sin, where\nAdam and Eve's disobedience in the Garden of Eden led to the fall of humanity and the need for a savior to\nredeem them. In Islam, every person is born pure and without sin, and it is their actions and choices that\ndetermine their spiritual status in the eyes of Allah. Therefore, the idea of a savior dying for the sins of humanity\nis not relevant in Islamic theology.\nAdditionally, Muhammad's role as a prophet was to convey the message of Islam to humanity, to teach them\nabout Allah's commands and to guide them towards the path of righteousness. He was not sent to die for the\nsins of humanity, but to teach them how to live and worship in a way that pleases Allah. His teachings and\nexample remain as a guide for Muslims to this day, and his message of peace, justice, and compassion continue\nto inspire millions around the world.\nIn conclusion, the idea that Muhammad should have died for the sins of Muslims is not relevant in Islamic\ntheology. In Islam, every individual is responsible for their own deeds and must ask for forgiveness from Allah.\nMuhammad's role as a prophet was to convey the message of Islam and to teach people how to live in\naccordance with Allah's commands.

Jesus (also known as Isa in\nArabic) is considered a mighty Prophet of Allah, who was born miraculously to Virgin Mary and performed\nnumerous miracles through the power of God's will. Similarly, Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the last\nprophet sent by Allah with the final revelation of Islam, which completes the cycle of divine guidance for\nhumanity. While Christians view Jesus as the son of God and worship Him, Muslims view Him only and solely as\none amongst many prophets sent by Allah to guide His people towards righteousness.

          "answer": "The crescent, also known as Hilal in Arabic, is a symbol that represents the Islamic faith and has its roots\nembedded in pre-Islamic Arabian culture. The crescent moon was a common motif used by the Arabs before the\nadvent of Islam and was linked to their worship of various deities, with each tribe having its own interpretation of\nit. However, with the rise of Islam in the seventh century, it quickly became associated with the Muslim lunar\ncalendar. The sighting of the crescent moon marks the beginning and end of Ramadan, one of the most\nimportant months for Muslims. It also features prominently on flags and emblems representing Islamic nations\nand organizations worldwide. Despite being an ancient cultural symbol that predates Islam, today, Muslims\nprimarily identify with it due to its significance within their religion.\nThe Islamic crescent is a symbol that represents the Muslim faith and has become one of the most widely\nrecognized religious symbols in the world. The crescent, which is also known as the hilal, is believed to have\noriginated during the early days of Islam and has been used as a symbol of the faith ever since.\nThe crescent has been associated with Islam since the very beginning of the religion. According to some\nscholars, the crescent was a symbol of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who used it to represent the new moon,\nwhich was considered to be a symbol of renewal and rebirth. This association with the new moon made the\ncrescent a powerful symbol in Islamic culture and it has been used in various contexts throughout history.\nOne of the earliest descriptions of the Islamic crescent can be found in the Quran, the holy book of Islam. In\nSurah Al-Baqarah (2:189), it is described as “a new moon with a curved edge,” which is believed to refer to the\ncrescent shape of the moon when it is still visible after the new moon.\nThe crescent was also used as a symbol by the Ottoman Empire, which ruled over a large part of the Muslim\nworld for centuries. The Ottoman flag featured a crescent and star, which were seen as symbols of Islam and the\nempire’s power. This tradition has continued to this day, and the flag of Turkey still features a crescent and star.\nIn addition to its use in flags and other symbols, the crescent has also been used in Islamic art and architecture.\nIt is often found in mosques and other religious buildings, where it is used as a decorative element or as part of\nthe overall design.\nOverall, the crescent is a symbol that has played a significant role in Islamic culture for centuries. It is believed to\nrepresent the renewal and rebirth that are at the heart of the Islamic faith, and it has been used as a symbol of\npower and authority throughout history. Today, the crescent remains an important symbol of Islam, and it can be\nfound in a variety of contexts both in the Muslim world and beyond.",

          "question": "44. What do you think about the miracles which happen in the church?",
          "answer": "Islam acknowledges the occurrence of miracles in Christianity as per its teachings expressed in the Qur'an.\nHowever, Muslim scholars hold a nuanced perspective on these events. Muslims believe that Prophet Jesus\nperformed many miraculous deeds in his lifetime but refute the belief that he was the son of God. Therefore,\nMuslim scholars argue that any reference to miracles occurring within churches is an ambiguous concept and\nmay not necessarily imply their validity or authenticity. Furthermore, Islam emphasises using evidence-based\nreasoning and rational thinking when evaluating claims of extraordinary events. Therefore, while Islamic\nteachings acknowledge supernatural occurrences taking place within or around religious institutions, they often\nview them with scepticism and require thorough investigation before accepting them as authentic evidence of\ndivinity or divine intervention.\nIslam is a religion with a deep respect for the miracles that occurred through the prophets and messengers in the\npast. However, when it comes to the miracles that happen in the church, Muslims view them with a more\nskeptical eye. In Islam, miracles are only valid if they are in line with the teachings of the Quran and the Prophet\nMuhammad, peace be upon him. Hence, the miracle stories that originate from the church are not accepted in\nthe same context as those found in Islamic literature.\nIslam believes that the miracles of the prophets, such as Moses parting the Red Sea, the miraculous birth of\nJesus Christ, and the splitting of the moon by Prophet Muhammad were all divine interventions that happened to\nsupport the message and teachings of the prophets. The primary goal of these miracles was to prove to people\nthat the prophet was genuine and that the message they were conveying was from God. The Quran validates the\nmiracles of Jesus in the Bible, stating that he performed many miracles, including healing the sick and even\nraising the dead. However, the concept of someone performing the same types of miracles today is viewed with\na more skeptical eye, as Islam teaches that miracles were only given to the prophets to support divine\nmessages.\nThis brings us to the miracles in the church. Although some miracles that are claimed to have occurred in the\nchurch can be explained, many still remain a mystery. In Islam, there is no outright denial of these miracles, but\nthey are not validated without comprehensive research and investigation. Mistakes can happen, and it is\nessential to ensure there are no falsehoods or exaggerations; hence the principles of verifying information are\nessential for Muslims. It is believed that some Christian miracles are viewed as good deeds inspired by God to\nshow the power of faith and the benefits of piety.\nMuslims believe in the unity of religions granted by God, and all previous prophets were sent messages with the\nsame essential instructions: to follow divine guidance and to do good. Therefore, it is not appropriate to reject\nsuch miracles, but they do not necessarily fit into the Islamic narrative. As a matter of fact, Muslims believe that\nsome of the practices in Christianity, for instance, are vitalizing and hold values akin to Islam. Islam sees Jesus\nas a significant member of the Prophetate and he is familiarly accounted to as \"Isa ibn Maryam\" (Jesus son of\nMary). He is highlighted in the Quran and Muslims are encouraged to respect and admired his character and\nkindness.\nIn conclusion, while miracles are often viewed with amazement and referred to as evidence of divine power,\nMuslims prefer to keep a rational and logical approach to when faced with them. Muslims believe that only true\nmiracles are those that support the pure teachings of Islam conveyed through the Prophet Muhammad. On the\nother hand, miracles that happen in the church are neither denied nor affirmed as they are viewed differently by\nIslam compared to Christianity. However, this does not imply a complete rejection or denial of the claims made,\nand the need for further inquiry and research",

          "answer": "In recent years, there has been a surge in the number of people converting to Islam. This can be attributed to a\nvariety of factors. Firstly, Islam offers a clear and concise set of beliefs and practices that provide guidance on\nhow one should lead their life. In an increasingly complex world, many people are turning towards religions that\noffer clarity and direction. Additionally, Islam has been portrayed positively by many Islamic scholars who have\nemphasized the religion's peaceful message and its emphasis on social justice. The rise of social media\nplatforms has also played a crucial role in spreading awareness about Islam to audiences worldwide, making it\nmore accessible for those seeking knowledge about the faith. Lastly, personal experiences with Muslims have\nalso led some individuals to convert as they witness the positive impact that practicing Muslims have had on their\nlives. These reasons are why so many people have recently joined Islam, and this trend is expected to continue\nin upcoming times.\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of people converting to Islam. This sudden\nsurge of new converts to Islam has perplexed many people, as it has come at a time when the religion is being\nportrayed negatively by the media, especially in the Western world.

          "question": "Islam? What is it about this religion that's causing people to convert?",
          "answer": "There are different reasons why people are joining Islam. One of the most significant reasons is the inner peace\nand fulfillment that Islam provides. Unlike other religions, Islam is not merely a set of beliefs and rituals but rather\na complete way of life. It provides guidance for all aspects of life, including personal conduct, social interactions,\nand economic relationships, resulting in a balanced and fulfilling life. The Qur'an's teachings, the sayings of\nProphet Muhammad, and his examples all contribute to this moral and ethical system, which appeals to many\npeople. Islam encourages its followers to refrain from negative activities such as lying, stealing, and harming\nothers; this helps them achieve inner peace.\nA second reason many people are converting to Islam is the universality of its message. Islam recognizes the\nfact that all human beings are equal, regardless of their race, gender, or nationality. The religion advocates the\nimportance of building strong and mutually supportive relationships between individuals and communities\nregardless of their spiritual beliefs. Many people who join Islam see the religion as one of universal unity and\nregard the faith as a way to work for the betterment of all humanity.\nAnother reason why people are joining Islam is the sense of community and brotherhood that is created among\nMuslims. Converts who were previously struggling to find a sense of family or belonging find acceptance and\nsupport in the Muslim community. Islam promotes building relationships with fellow believers, and converts often\nfeel a sense of camaraderie and true connection with their new brothers and sisters in Islam.\nFinally, some people convert to Islam after being introduced to its beautiful and inspiring teachings. The Qur'an is\nknown for its beautiful language and vivid descriptions of the afterlife, with endless rewards and blessings\npromised to those who follow Allah's path. Many converts find themselves being drawn towards the poetic\nlanguage and beautiful imagery in the Qur'an, inspiring them to learn more about the faith and eventually\nbecome Muslim.\nIn summary, the reasons why many people are joining Islam in recent times are diverse and multifaceted.\nWhether it is the peaceful and fulfilling way of life, the universality of its message, the sense of community, or its\nbeautiful teachings, each individual finds their own unique inspiration that leads them towards converting to\nIslam. Through Islam, people are finding meaning and purpose, as well as an upward trajectory in their spiritual\njourney.",

          "question": "46. Where is God why we can't see him or hear him?",
          "answer": "The question of the existence and whereabouts of God has puzzled scholars and laypeople alike for centuries.\nFrom a philosophical perspective, some argue that the nature of God as an omnipotent being transcends human\nperception, rendering him unknowable through sensory experiences such as sight or sound. Others contend that\nfaith is the means by which we perceive God's presence in our lives. Psychologically, it has been suggested that\nour inability to perceive God may be due to cognitive biases or perceptual limitations arising from our individual\nexperiences and cultures. Whether approached from a religious or scientific standpoint, the question of why we\ncannot perceive God remains a topic of ongoing debate among scholars and theologians. Ultimately, it is up to\neach individual to reconcile their beliefs about spirituality with their own experiences of reality.\nReligion has always been a subject of curiosity and controversy. Many people have wondered about God's\nexistence or questioned the rationale behind his invisibility and silence. This essay will endeavor to explore some\nof the reasons why we cannot see or hear God.\nFirstly, it's important to understand that God's existence is a matter of faith rather than physical evidence. Many\nreligious texts depict God as an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent being who cannot be seen or heard by\nmere mortals. Mathew 5:8 further supports this narrative when it states, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they\nshall see God.\" In essence, this verse suggests that only those with a pure heart can see God, which is\nimpossible for most people.\nSecondly, God's invisibility and silence can be attributed to the concept of free will. God created humans and\ngave them the ability to make choices and decisions for themselves. He respects this freedom and does not\nforce himself upon them. This idea is further supported by the Quran 2:256 which states, \"There is no\ncompulsion in religion.\" This verse illustrates that God wants mankind to choose to believe in him out of their own\nfree will.\nFurthermore, the human mind has limitations; it cannot comprehend the reality of God, let alone perceive him.\nTheologians argue that God is too divine and too vast for our minds to fathom or detect. This assertion can be\nseen in 1 Corinthians 2:14, where it states, \"But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God,\nfor they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them because they are spiritually discerned.\"\nLastly, God's silence and invisibility could be seen as a test of faith. In essence, it's through adversity and\nchallenges that a believer strengthens their faith in God's existence. James 1:12 depicts this notion, stating,\n\"Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been tried, he shall receive the crown of life,\nwhich the Lord has promised to those who love him.\"\nIn conclusion, the question of God's invisibility has been a subject of debate and controversy. This essay has\nshown that God's existence is a matter of faith, and that his invisibility and silence can be attributed to his divine\nnature, human limitations, free will, and a test of faith. Hence, believers must continue to have faith in his\nexistence and trust in his plan for their lives.",

          "question": "47. Who created God why he doesn’t have parents ?",
          "answer": "In Islam, God is regarded as the ultimate Creator and Sustainer of the universe. He existed before time, space,\nmatter, and all other creations came into existence. According to Islamic theology, God is self-sufficient and does\nnot require any external help or support to maintain His existence. Thus, asking who created God is considered\nmeaningless and illogical since the concept of causality only applies to the material world. Islam asserts that God\nhas no parents or offspring because it contradicts His nature as an eternal being without beginning or end. The\nQuran emphasizes that there is nothing like unto God nor has anyone ever seen Him, which indicates that He\ntranscends human comprehension and cannot be equated with anything in creation. Therefore, Islamic scholars\nstress on understanding God through His attributes and actions instead of trying to comprehend His essence or\norigin.\nOne of the most fundamental questions that humans have been asking since the beginning of time is, \"Who\ncreated God?\" While there are many different answers to this question, depending on one's religious or\nphilosophical beliefs, Islam clearly states that God does not have parents and is eternal.\nIn Islam, the concept of God is central to the entire faith, and the belief in the oneness of God is the first of the\nfive pillars of Islam. Muslims believe that God, or Allah, is the creator of everything in the universe and that He is\nwithout beginning, without end, and without any partners or relatives. This concept is called Tawheed, which\nmeans the belief in the oneness of God.\nAccording to Islamic teachings, God is an absolute and self-sufficient being who created the universe from\nnothing. He is not bound by time or space, and therefore, does not need parents or any other external factors to\nexist. God is not a created being, and there is no beginning or end to His existence.\nIslam teaches that God is the originator of everything in the universe, and He is the ultimate source of all power\nand knowledge. In the Quran, it is stated that God is \"the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End\" (Surah\nAl-Hadid, 57:3).\nMuslims believe that God is beyond human comprehension and that He cannot be fully understood by human\nbeings. However, Allah has chosen to reveal Himself to humanity through His messengers and prophets, as well\nas through the Quran.\nIn Islam, the belief in God's eternal existence is central to understanding the purpose of life. Muslims believe that\nthe purpose of life is to worship Allah alone, and to submit to His will. The Quran states, \"And I (Allah) did not\ncreate the jinn and mankind except to worship Me\" (Surah Ad-Dhariyat, 51:56).\nIn conclusion, the question of who created God is a fundamental one that has puzzled humans for centuries.\nHowever, in Islam, it is clearly stated that God does not have parents and is eternal. Muslims believe that God is\nself-sufficient, absolute, and the creator of everything in the universe. The belief in God's eternal existence is\ncentral to understanding the purpose of life and the importance of submitting to His will.\nEDIALOGUE",

          "question": "48. What is Islam?",
          "answer": "Islam is a monotheistic religion that originated in the Arabian Peninsula during the 7th century. The followers of\nIslam, known as Muslims, believe in one God (Allah) and follow the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, who\nreceived revelations from God through the angel Gabriel. The central text of Islam is the Quran, which Muslims\nbelieve to be the word of God as revealed to Muhammad. Five pillars are fundamental beliefs that all Muslims\nmust follow: confession of faith (shahada), ritual prayer (salat), giving to charity (zakat), fasting during Ramadan\n(sawm), and pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj). Islam emphasizes compassion, fairness, social justice, and respect for\nhuman rights. It is an inclusive religion that welcomes people of all races and backgrounds into its fold. However,\nIslam has been misinterpreted by some extremist groups who use it to justify their violent actions against\ninnocent people.\nIslam is a monotheistic religion followed by over 1.8 billion people across the globe, making it the second-largest\nreligion in the world. The term \"Islam\" means \"submission\" in Arabic, and the fundamental belief of Islam is that\nthere is only one God, known as Allah, who is the all-powerful creator of the universe. Islam is based on the\nteachings of the prophet Muhammad, who is considered the last and most important prophet of God in Islam.\nThe teachings of Islam are compiled in a holy book, known as the Quran, which Muslims believe to be the direct\nword of Allah. Muslims believe that the Quran offers guidance for all aspects of life, including relationships,\nethics, and morality. It also contains stories of previous prophets and their messages, including Adam, Abraham,\nMoses, and Jesus.\nIn addition to the Quran, Muslims also follow the teachings of the hadith, which are narrations about the life and\nsayings of Muhammad. The hadith comprises some of the most important texts in Islamic law and ethics, guiding\nMuslims on how to live according to the principles of Islam.\nMuslims believe that the ultimate goal of life is to honor and serve Allah, and to seek guidance and reward\nthrough following his teachings. Muslims follow five main pillars of Islam, which include the declaration of faith\n(shahada), prayer (salah), fasting (sawm), charity (zakat), and pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) at least once in their\nlifetime if they are financially and physically able to do so.\nIslamic culture is rich and diverse, with a strong emphasis on community and family values. Muslims believe in\nbeing kind and hospitable to others, regardless of their background, race, or religion. Islamic art and architecture\nare also an important part of Islamic culture, with intricate designs and patterns that reflect the faith's emphasis\non the beauty of creation and the importance of spirituality.\nIslam has also had an impact on politics and society since its inception. Some Muslims advocate for Islamic law\n(Sharia) as a source of legislation in Muslim-majority countries, while others prefer secular governance with\nIslamic values integrated into the legal and social frameworks. The role of Islam in politics and government is a\ncomplex and ongoing issue.\nIn conclusion, Islam is a diverse and dynamic faith with a rich history and culture. Its teachings emphasize the\noneness of God, the importance of following his guidance, and the value of community and family. Muslims\naround the world practice Islam in different ways, but all share a commitment to honoring Allah and striving for\nrighteousness in all aspects of life.",

          "question": "49. How can I convert to Islam?",
          "answer": "Converting to Islam requires significant contemplation, study, and a genuine desire to embrace the faith. One\nshould start by researching the fundamental beliefs of Islam, its practices, and its history. This can be done\nthrough reading available literature, attending lectures, or consulting with knowledgeable individuals. The next\nstep is to recite the Shahada, which is the declaration of faith in Islam. This entails affirming that there is no deity\nworthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is His prophet. It is also essential to\nadopt Islamic practices such as prayer, fasting during Ramadan, giving Zakat (charity), and making a pilgrimage\nto Mecca if possible. Joining an Islamic community can significantly aid in one's conversion as they provide\nmoral support and guidance for new members. Ultimately, sincere commitment and adherence are crucial in\nembracing any religion fully.\nConverting to Islam is a serious decision that requires deep understanding and contemplation. Islam is\nthe world's second-largest religion, with over 1.5 billion followers worldwide. It's a faith that emphasizes\ncharacter, honesty, and compassion towards others. Converting to Islam can be a life-changing\nexperience, and it's essential to understand the practices and beliefs before taking such a step.\nThe first step towards converting to Islam is to gain knowledge about the religion's core beliefs and\npractices. Reading the Quran and other essential Islamic texts is an excellent way to get started. The\nQuran is the holy book of Islam, and it contains Allah's teachings and the Prophet Muhammad's words,\nwho is the final prophet of Islam. Getting familiar with the five pillars of Islam, such as Salah (prayer),\nZakat (charity), Sawm (fasting), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca), is also important.\nOnce you've gained sufficient knowledge about the religion, the next step is to make the declaration of\nfaith, which is also known as the shahada. The shahada is a proclamation of one's belief in the oneness\nof Allah and the prophethood of Muhammad. Saying the shahada in front of witnesses or reciting it in\nprivate is enough to convert to Islam.\nAfter accepting Islam, it's crucial to begin learning about the Islamic way of life. Seek guidance from\nknowledgeable Muslims and make an effort to attend mosque regularly. Gaining an understanding of\nIslamic traditions and culture can be a great asset in living as a Muslim.\nOne of the critical elements of the Islamic faith is praying five times a day. Learning how to perform the\nSalah is necessary. It's a good idea to learn from someone well versed in Islamic prayer or attending a\nlocal mosque where people can help to learn the rituals.\nAnother significant aspect of Islamic faith is charity, a fundamental principle of Islam. Muslims are\nobligated to give a portion of their wealth annually to help those in need. Muslims should be generous\nwith their wealth, give to charitable causes, and spend time helping people in their communities.\nAdditionally, fasting is an essential part of the Islamic faith. Muslims fast from dawn to dusk during the\nHoly month of Ramadan, abstaining from food, drink and other physical needs. It is one of the most\nsignificant acts of worship, as it helps to purify the soul and improve one's relationship with God.\nFinally, the pilgrimage (Hajj) to Mecca is considered a significant obligation for every capable Muslim. It\nis a once-in-a-lifetime journey that allows Muslims worldwide to be united in their faith and worship. It is\na personal and spiritual journey to seek forgiveness and draw closer to God.\nIn conclusion, converting to Islam is a beautiful decision, but it requires adequate preparation,\nknowledge, and commitment. It can be challenging initially but rewarding in the long term. After making\nthe declaration of faith, it's essential to learn the fundamentals of Islam's practices",

          "answer": "The five pillars of Islam are the fundamental practices that every Muslim must follow. The first pillar is Shahada,\nwhich is the declaration of faith in Allah and the Prophet Muhammad as His messenger. The second pillar is\nSalah, referring to the obligatory daily prayers performed five times a day. The third pillar is Zakat, meaning\ngiving alms or charity to the needy and less fortunate. The fourth pillar is Sawm, or fasting during Ramadan for\nan entire month as an act of devotion and self-discipline.

These pillars represent essential\ntenets that guide Muslims in their relationship with God and other people and emphasize individual devotion\nalongside communal practice, charity and kindness amidst struggle: culminating into fulfilling one's obligations\ntowards fellow humans on this shared earth before being rewarded in heaven after death.\nIslam is one of the major religions of the world, with over 1.8 billion followers. It is a complete way of life, and its\ncore principles are represented by its five pillars. These pillars are regarded as the foundation of Islam and\nprovide a framework for Muslims to follow. Each pillar has its own unique significance, and by observing all five\nof them, a Muslim can strengthen their faith and connect with Allah.\nThe first pillar is Shahada or the declaration of faith. It is the fundamental statement that reflects a Muslim's\nbeliefs in Allah and Muhammad, as his prophet. It is a simple statement, \"There is no god but Allah, and\nMuhammad is his messenger.\" By reciting this statement, a Muslim acknowledges the supremacy of Allah and\naccepts the teachings of the Prophet, making a commitment to follow them.\nThe second pillar is Salah or prayer. Every Muslim is required to offer five daily prayers, which are held at\nspecific times throughout the day. Prayer is the most direct way of establishing a connection with Allah, and\nMuslims are encouraged to perform it in congregation. It also provides a sense of discipline, as individuals are\nrequired to follow a specific format and posture during prayer.\nThe third pillar is Zakat or charity. It is a mandatory obligation on Muslims to give a portion of their wealth to\nthose in need. By giving Zakat, Muslims demonstrate their commitment to social justice, compassion, and\ngenerosity towards others. It helps to create a sense of community and unity amongst fellow Muslims by\nhighlighting the importance of taking care of each other.\nThe fourth pillar is Sawm or fasting. It is observed during the month of Ramadan, where Muslims refrain from\neating, drinking, and engaging in any physical desires during daylight hours. Fasting is seen as a way to purify\nthe soul, gain self-discipline, and empathize with those who are less fortunate. It is also a way of practicing\nself-control and learning to be mindful of one's actions.\nThe fifth and last pillar is Hajj or pilgrimage. It is a journey to the holy city of Mecca, where Muslims gather for a\nspecific time to perform several rituals at the Kaaba. It is an essential obligation for Muslims who are physically\nand financially able to undertake it once in their lifetime. The Hajj provides a unique opportunity for Muslims\nworldwide to come together, connect with one another, and strengthen their faith.\nIn conclusion, the five pillars of Islam provide guidelines for Muslims to follow and connect with Allah. They act\nas the foundation of one's faith and are integral in becoming a better, more devout Muslim. Each pillar represents\na different aspect of Islam, and by observing them, Muslims can achieve a sense of inner peace, discipline, and\nsocial responsibility. The pillars of Islam demonstrate Allah's compassion and love towards his creation and\nserve as a reminder to humanity of the importance of fulfilling their religious duties.",

          "question": "51. Why should I pray?",
          "answer": "As a Muslim, the daily prayers hold great significance in our faith and are mandatory for every able-bodied adult.\nPrayer connects us with Allah and reminds us of His presence in our lives, allowing us to seek blessings and\nguidance from Him. It also helps to purify our hearts and minds, reminding us of our ultimate purpose in life - to\nworship Allah alone. The act of prayer teaches discipline, punctuality and patience which can be applied in all\naspects of our lives.

          "question": "52. Is Jesus the son of God in Islam?",
          "answer": "In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God; however, the concept of him being the son of\nGod is rejected. This notion contradicts the Islamic belief in monotheism, which emphasizes that there is only\none divine entity who created all things. Muslims believe that Jesus was born to Virgin Mary through a\nmiraculous birth, which was a sign from Allah’s power and mercy. According to Islamic teachings, Jesus\nperformed miracles like healing the sick and raising the dead with permission from Allah but not by his own will\nor authority. Muslims also believe that he didn't die on the cross but ascended to heaven alive where he currently\nawaits his return just like other major prophets such as Mohammed himself. In conclusion, while Jesus holds\ngreat respect in Islam as an esteemed prophet among many others sent from Allah throughout history till Quran\ndescribed him as being “honoured in this world and Hereafter” (Quran 3:45), what sets him apart isn’t any special\ndivinity that could put him above limitations consistent for human beings on earth but his extra-ordinary teachings\nand wisdom coupled with miraculous powers bestowed upon him by Almighty alone for guidance of mankind\ntowards salvation.\nIslam and Christianity share many beliefs, but one of the most significant differences between these two religions\nis on the subject of Jesus. The question of whether Jesus is the son of God in Islam is a complex one that has\nbeen debated by scholars for centuries. While the Islamic faith recognizes Jesus as a prophet, they do not\nbelieve he is the son of God. In this essay, we will explore the Islamic perspective on Jesus and his position in\nthe Islamic faith.\nFirstly, it’s essential to understand that Islam regards Jesus as one of the most important prophets. Muslims\nbelieve that he was born of the virgin Mary, who is one of the most respected women in Islam. They also believe\nthat Jesus performed miracles through the power of Allah, including healing the sick and raising the dead.\nProphet Jesus is also granted a high degree of respect in Islamic culture and holds a special place in the hearts\nof many Muslims.\nHowever, the significant difference between Christianity and Islam regarding Jesus is that Islam does not believe\nthat he is the son of God. Allah is believed to be above the need and capacity of having offspring or containing\nany partners. “Say, \"He is Allah, the One; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not nor is He begotten. And\nthere is none like unto Him.\" (Quran, 112:1-4). From Islamic perspective, giving birth is a distinct property of\nwomen, and it dishonors Allah to consider him having a partner or an equal. Therefore, Muslims reject the\nconcept of the Trinity, which connects Allah with Jesus and the Holy Spirit.\nThe belief in the oneness of God (monotheism) is the most significant tenet of Islam, and associating a partner or\nequal with Allah is considered the most cardinal sin in this religion. Muslims believe that the word \"son\" as used\nin the Bible doesn't have a literal meaning but rather a symbolical term indicating a close or faithful relationship\nwith God. In the Quran, Prophet Jesus is referred to as \"The Messiah, son of Mary,\" who calls people to believe\nin Allah and called them to follow his message or guidance.\nFurthermore, Muslim scholars have argued against the concept of Jesus being the son of God by referring to\nhistorical evidence from the Bible. They believe that Jesus himself never claimed to be the son of God, and this\nidea is a later development in Christianity. Therefore, it is more a matter of interpretation rather than historical\nfacts or religious proofs.\nIn conclusion, while Muslims do not believe that Jesus is the son of God, they hold him in high regard as one of\nthe greatest prophets in Islam. Although there are differences between Islamic and Christian perspectives on\nProphet Jesus, some values stand in common ground such as Mary's virginity, Jesus's healing miracles, and\nguiding people towards a life of faith, and good deeds. Muslim beliefs about Jesus reflect an essential aspect of\nIslamic spirituality and deepen the ties between Islamic and Christian religions.",

          "question": "53. Do I have to change my name if I become a Muslim?",
          "answer": "No, there is no Islamic requirement to change your name if you become a Muslim. However, it is recommended\nto choose a name that has a good meaning and reflects well on the religion. In Islamic tradition, a person's name\nholds signification and importance, therefore selecting an appropriate name can be seen as an opportunity to\nstrengthen one's relationship with God. Many Muslims choose Arabic names because of their historical\nsignificance in Islamic culture, but it is not mandatory for non-Arabic individuals to adopt such names. Ultimately,\nthe decision to change or keep one's name after conversion lies with the individual based on their personal\npreference and circumstances. It is important for new converts to consult with knowledgeable Muslim scholars or\nleaders who can provide guidance during this process of transition.\nChanging one's name is a voluntary act, and while it is recommended to choose a suitable name according to\nIslamic etiquette, it is not an obligation. Islam recognizes the importance of identity and a person's name plays a\nsignificant role in defining one's identity. Therefore, it is a common practice for individuals who embrace Islam to\nchange their name to a more appropriate and meaningful one. However, many Muslims continue to use their\nbirth name, and there is no requirement in the Quran or Sunnah to adopt a new name.\nWhen someone converts to Islam, it is a significant life-changing decision. They are reborn as a new person, and\nit is natural for them to want to reinvent themselves. Changing one's name is a way to symbolize this renewal of\nfaith and identify themselves with the Islamic values they have embraced. It enables them to let go of any\nnegative associations with their previous life and embrace a new identity that aligns with their beliefs.\nHowever, choosing to adopt a new name is not a decision to be taken lightly. Islam places great importance on\none's intention, and the intention behind the name change is crucial. The new name should reflect the person's\npersonality, beliefs and the values they aspire to live by. It should also be easy to pronounce and not mimic the\nnames of non-Muslim deities, as Islam prohibits any association with other religions.\nMoreover, it is important to remember that Islam does not forbid the use of non-Arabic or non-Muslim names.\nIslam is a universal religion that welcomes people from all corners of the world, and their names are a part of\ntheir cultural heritage. There are examples of companions of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) and\nscholars in Islam who kept their non-Arabic names after embracing Islam. This shows that Islam promotes\ndiversity and does not require everyone to adopt an Arabic or a Muslim name.\nIn conclusion, changing one's name upon converting to Islam is a personal choice. While it is a common\npractice, it is not an obligation in Islam. If one chooses to change their name, it should reflect their personality\nand identity, and not mimic the names of other religions. One's cultural heritage and diversity should be\ncelebrated, and Islam does not require everyone to have an Arabic or Muslim name. Therefore, it is essential to\nmake an informed, heartfelt decision when considering a name change and ensure that the intention behind it is\npure",

          "question": "54. Why do you pray five times a day?",
          "answer": "As a fundamental pillar of Islam, the act of praying five times a day is an essential component of a Muslim's daily\nlife. The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of maintaining spiritual connection with Allah throughout the day,\nand prayer is seen as an opportunity to seek forgiveness, express gratitude, and ask for guidance. Moreover,\nprayer serves as a reminder that Allah is constantly watching over us and that we should strive to live our lives\nwith piety and mindfulness. By praying at specific times each day - before dawn, midday, midafternoon,\nsundown, and after dark - Muslims are able to structure their routines around this central religious practice.\nPrayer also promotes discipline and self-control while encouraging individual growth in faith by helping people\nturn away from worldly distractions and focus on their relationship with Allah. For many believers, the daily ritual\nof prayer provides emotional comfort and an unmatched sense of purpose in life.\nAs a Muslim, prayer holds a significant place in my life. One of the fundamental pillars of Islam is Salah or\nprayer, which involves the act of prostrating oneself before Allah five times a day. This practice is deeply\ningrained in our faith and has been instilled since childhood, but it is not just a religious obligation; it serves a\nmore profound and comprehensive purpose in our spiritual journey.\nFirstly, praying five times a day helps to maintain our connection with Allah throughout the day. As Muslims, our\nultimate goal is to submit to Allah's will, and Salah helps us to focus our attention towards Him, ensuring that our\nconsistency of faith remains even in the most challenging of situations. It provides a reminder to us that no\nmatter how busy our lives may become or the pressures we may face, Allah is always there and is only a prayer\naway.\nAdditionally, Salah is a source of spiritual purification. It is a cleansing ritual for our minds and souls, as we\ncleanse ourselves physically with water before prayer, this purification is extended to the soul during the act of\nSalah. It helps to wash away any impurities and negativities that may have accumulated during our daily\nactivities, leaving us refreshed and pure.\nMoreover, Salah acts as a unifying factor among Muslims. All Muslims perform the same rituals of purification\nand recitation of verses from the Quran during prayer, regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity. Thus, it reinforces\nthe sense of brotherhood and sisterhood among Muslims and promotes a sense of community.\nLastly, Salah enhances our spiritual and mental well-being. The act of standing before Allah and reciting His\nwords provides a sense of peace and tranquillity to the mind and the soul. It strengthens our relationship with\nAllah, which we often seek in times of trouble, and instills confidence in our faith. Salah helps us to remember\nAllah and his blessings, and it provides a sense of purpose and meaning to our daily lives.\nIn conclusion, Salah is an essential aspect of a Muslim's life, and performing it five times a day holds great\nsignificance. It helps us to maintain our connection with Allah, purify our souls and minds, unify us with other\nMuslims, and strengthens our spiritual well-being. Therefore, it is not just an obligation but a means of spiritual\ndevelopment and growth that helps us to lead a fulfilled and meaningful life.",

          "answer": "Muhammad is the prophet of Islam who received divine revelations from Allah, which later became the sacred\ntext of Quran. Born in Mecca in 570 AD, he was orphaned at an early age and raised by his grandfather and\nuncle. In his early life, he worked as a shepherd and then as a merchant. At the age of 40, he began receiving\nrevelations from Allah through Angel Gabriel, which continued until his death. Muhammad devoted his life to\nspreading the teachings of Islam and forming a community called Ummah based on the principles of justice,\nequality, charity and submission to Allah's will. Muslims regard him as a model for ethical behavior and follow his\nexample in personal conduct, social relationships and religious practices. His prophethood marked the beginning\nof Islamic civilization and continues to shape Muslim identity and spirituality today.\nMuhammad is the central figure of Islam, and he is believed to be the last prophet sent by Allah (God) to guide\nand teach humanity. Born in Mecca in 570 AD, Muhammad was orphaned at an early age and raised by his\ngrandfather and uncle. He worked as a merchant and lived a comparatively ordinary life until he received his first\nrevelation from Allah at the age of 40.\nThis event took place in a cave outside of Mecca, where Muhammad had retreated for contemplation and\nreflection. There, he was visited by the angel Gabriel, who delivered the first of many revelations that would later\nbecome the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam. These revelations continued to come to Muhammad over the next 23\nyears of his life, guiding him and teaching him how to live a life that would please Allah.\nMuhammad's teachings and the revelations he received established the core principles of Islam, emphasizing\nthe importance of faith and good deeds, social justice, and the equality of all believers. He preached the oneness\nof God and the need for people to submit to his will. Muhammad's teachings also established the Five Pillars of\nIslam, which include the declaration of faith, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage to Mecca.\nApart from being a prophet and messenger of Allah, Muhammad is highly revered and respected by Muslims as\nan exemplary human being. Accounts of his life detail his virtues which became exemplary to the believers, from\nhis kindness, honesty, and generosity to his patience, humility, and compassion towards his fellow beings. He is\nseen as a model of faith, piety, and righteousness who demonstrated how to live a life devoted to God while also\nbeing fully engaged in the world.\nMuslims view Muhammad's life as a shining example of humility, simplicity, and service to others. He is said to\nhave emphasized the importance of treating all people with kindness and respect, regardless of their race,\nreligion, or social status. He spoke out against oppression and injustice, and fought to defend the rights of those\nwho were marginalized or oppressed. These actions are reflected in his teachings of social justice and the\nequality of all people under the eyes of Allah.\nIn conclusion, Muhammad is regarded as the final and most important prophet in the Islamic faith. He is seen as\na model of love, compassion, and service to one's fellow humanity. His teachings and revelations form the very\nfoundation of Islam, including the Five Pillars that guide the religious practice of Muslims worldwide. His life and\ncharacter are reflective of the best qualities that a human being can possess, and thus, Muslims deeply revere\nand respect him. His life and teachings have impacted the world profoundly, leaving behind a legacy of peace\nand compassion.",

          "question": "56. What's your evidence for the Quran?",
          "answer": "The evidence for the Quran stems from its unique literary style, its coherence, and its historical accuracy. The\nArabic language used in the Quran is considered one of the most refined and sophisticated forms of the\nlanguage, displaying incredible literary beauty and eloquence that is unmatched in any other book or text.\nAdditionally, the consistent message, themes, and structure found throughout the entire book represent a\ncoherent message that could not have been produced by an individual without divine intervention. Furthermore,\nthe Quran contains a great deal of accurate information about historical events and places from different time\nperiods, which has been confirmed through archaeological discoveries. This consistency in both form and\ncontent provides substantive evidence towards it being a divine revelation as claimed by Islamic tradition.\nThe Quran, the holy book of Islam, has been a subject of extensive debate and discussion among\nscholars for decades. Muslims revere it as the Words of Allah transmitted to the Prophet Muhammad\nthrough the Angel Gabriel. The Quran forms the backbone of Islam, and it is considered the most reliable\nand authentic source of knowledge about their religion. The question of evidence for the Quran has been\nmuch-discussed, and in this essay, we will attempt to explore some of the evidence available in support\nof its authenticity.\nFirst and foremost, Muslims believe that the Quran is divine because Allah Himself has testified to it.\nMany verses in the Quran claim to be the Words of Allah, and this is taken as evidence of its authenticity\nby Muslims. The Quran says, “Verily, We have sent down the Reminder (the Quran), and surely, We will\nguard it (from corruption).” [Quran 15:9]. Thus Muslims consider it the exact words the Almighty\nrevealed to His Prophet.\nSecondly, historical evidence shows that the Quran is the same as it was during the time of the Prophet\nMuhammad. The Quran was written down in the 7th century, during the lifetime of the Prophet, on\nvarious materials such as bones, leather and parchment papers. Many companions of the Prophet wrote\ndown the Quranic verses, and it was compiled under the supervision of the Prophet himself, as\ndescribed in several authentic Hadiths.\nFurthermore, the Quranic verses contained in the present-day Quran that originated in the seventh\ncentury are similar, if not identical, to those inscribed on rocks and other surfaces in Arabia and dated\nback to the early seventh century. Many verses of Quran were either memorized by the Prophet's\ncompanions or engraved on stones and mentioned in Hadiths. Additionally, the first four Caliphs of\nIslam kept copies of the Quran and corrected any errors. This is evidence that the Quran has been\npreserved with exceptional accuracy from the early days of Islam.\nThe linguistic style and coherence of the Quran is another evidence that it must be the divine revelation.\nThe Quran is written in unique and incomparable Arabic, even though it was revealed over 1400 years\nago. Its grammatical structure, rhyme, rhythm, and spelling have never been matched, despite several\nattempts by experts in Arabic language. Muslims believe that the inimitable literary style of the Quran is\nimpossible for any human to replicate, and this is indicative of its divine origin.\nIn conclusion, there are several pieces of evidence supporting the authenticity of the Quran. Muslims\nfirmly believe that the Quran is the direct word of Allah, and this is a belief that is unshakable.\nFurthermore, the Quran has been preserved with exceptional accuracy since the time of the Prophet, and\nhistorical evidence shows that it has not been corrupted in any way. The linguistic style and coherence\nof the Quran is remarkable and has never been equalled by any other piece of literature. Thus, it can be\nconcluded that the evidence for the Quran's authenticity is solid,",

          "question": "57. Where is happiness?",
          "answer": "In Islam, happiness is not simply a transient emotion but instead a state of contentment that one can achieve\nthrough fulfilling their duties towards Allah and living a moral life. True happiness comes from being in harmony\nwith oneself and one’s environment, as well as from engaging in acts of worship, kindness to others, and\npursuing righteous actions. The Quran describes paradise as the ultimate abode of bliss and joy in which\nbelievers will attain true happiness free from all forms of sorrow and grief. Additionally, it is emphasized that\nmaterial possessions or worldly success should not be equated with happiness or define one's value as a\nperson; rather, true fulfillment lies in leading an ethical life, seeking knowledge, helping those in need, worshiping\nAllah sincerely, reflecting on His creation, and having faith in His divine plan. Hence, the Islamic perspective on\nhappiness revolves around achieving inner peace by fulfilling one’s spiritual and social obligations while holding\nonto hope for eternal reward.\nHappiness is a widely sought-after concept, and it is vital for every human being. Islam gives us an\nunderstanding of what happiness is and how we can achieve it. Muslims believe that happiness lies in living a\nfulfilling life, both spiritually and physically. Muslims find happiness by following the Quran, Sunnah, and the\nguidance provided by the Prophet Muhammad.\nIslam teaches that happiness is not merely dependent on worldly pleasures or material possessions. Muslims\nbelieve that happiness is found in the remembrance of Allah and by fulfilling their obligations towards Him.\nMuslims find true happiness through a deep connection with Allah and an appreciation for every blessing that He\nhas bestowed upon them.\nIslam teaches that happiness lies in practicing the five pillars of Islam: the declaration of faith (Shahada),\nperforming the five daily prayers (Salah), fasting during Ramadan (Sawm), giving charity (Zakat), and making a\npilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). These five pillars provide believers with a sense of purpose and meaning in life, and\nthey allow Muslims to fulfill their obligations to Allah and their fellow human beings.\nIslam also emphasizes the importance of inner peace and tranquility. Muslims are encouraged to practice\nmindfulness and self-reflection to achieve inner peace. This can be done through daily prayers, reading Quran,\nand seeking guidance from knowledgeable individuals.

          "question": "58. What is the difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims?",
          "answer": "The primary difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims can be traced back to a disagreement over who should\nhave succeeded the Prophet Muhammad as the leader of the Islamic community. Sunnis believe that Abu Bakr,\na close companion of the Prophet, was rightfully appointed as caliph after Muhammad's death, while Shias argue\nthat Ali, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, was the rightful successor. This led to a split in Islam and\nsubsequent theological differences between the two groups. In terms of beliefs and practices, Sunnis make up\nthe majority of Muslims worldwide and tend to emphasize following established schools of thought and practice\n(madhabs). Shias place greater emphasis on individual interpretation and follow a succession of imams (leaders)\nwho are believed to be divinely guided. There are also notable differences in ritual practices such as prayer\nstyles and holiday observances between Sunni and Shia communities.\nSunni and Shia Islam are the two major sects comprising Islam. They differ in their religious beliefs, practices,\nand interpretation of the Quran. Despite their shared ancestry, these Islamic divisions have significantly different\nbeliefs, and their differences have led to significant historical and contemporary conflicts throughout the Muslim\nworld. This essay aims to highlight the salient differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims.\nThe primary difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims is their view of the authority of religious leaders. Shia\nMuslims believe that leadership of the Muslim community after prophet Muhammad's death should have passed\non to Ali, the prophet's cousin and son in law, through lineage. They also believe that Ali's descendants, known\nas Imams, possess spiritual and political authority inherited directly from the prophet. In contrast, Sunni Muslims\nbelieve that political authority should be given to the person best suited to lead the community according to the\nexample of the prophet Muhammad.\nAnother significant difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims is their religious practices. Although both sects\nshare many religious traditions, Shia Muslims have different holy days and a different religious calendar than\nSunni Muslims. For instance, Shia Muslims commemorate the martyrdom of Ali on the tenth day of Muharram,\nknown as Ashura, and the death of the Prophet's daughter, Fatima, on the fifth day of Jamadi-ul-Sani.\nAdditionally, there are differences in some of their religious practices. For example, in Shia Islam, pointing fingers\nduring prayer is a crucial ritual when taking an oath, while it is not mandatory in Sunni Islam. Likewise, Shia\nMuslims perform prayer three times a day, while Sunni Muslims offer five daily prayers.\nMoreover, Shia Muslims commemorate their Imams' deaths, while Sunni Muslims do not, claim that\ncommemoration in such a manner is unnecessary and not part of the teachings of the Prophet.\nFurthermore, Sunni and Shia Muslims have different opinions on various theological concepts, such as the\nnature of the Quran, the Imamate, and the concept of saints. For example, Shia Islam teaches that the Quran\nhas both an apparent (zahir) and an inner (batin) meaning, whereas Sunni Muslims believe the Quran is clear\nand straightforward. Similarly, Shia Muslims believe that the Imamate, or the spiritual and political authority, is a\ndivine appointment, while Sunni Muslims believe that leadership is based on consensus.\nIn Conclusion, the fundamental differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims are rooted in their beliefs around\nleadership, religious practices, and theological concepts. It is essential to understand these differences and\nrespect each sect's views to achieve a greater sense of shared humanity and peace in the Muslim world. While\ntheir differences have been the source of historical conflicts, mutual understanding and respect can lead towards\na greater unity, falling under the overarching umbrella of Islam.",

          "question": "59. Do Muslims believe in Jesus?",
          "answer": "Muslims believe in Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God, but they do not accept the belief that he is the\nson of God or part of the Holy Trinity. According to Islamic teachings, Jesus was one of the most important\nprophets sent by Allah before Prophet Muhammad. Muslims revere and respect him for his teachings and\nexemplary conduct. They also firmly believe in his miraculous birth from Virgin Mary, healing powers, and his\nascension into heaven. However, Islam vehemently opposes any notion that attributes divine qualities to any\nhuman being or an entity in partnership with God. Therefore, while Muslims have great reverence for Jesus as a\nholy figure sent from God, they do not equate him with divinity in the same way that Christians do.\nMuslims are followers of the Islamic faith, and one of the most common questions they are asked is whether or\nnot they believe in Jesus. The answer to this is yes, but it is important to understand the Muslim perspective on\nJesus and how it differs from that of Christians.\nIn Islam, Jesus, known as Isa in Arabic, is regarded as a prophet who was sent by Allah (God) to guide the\npeople of his time. He is considered to be one of the greatest prophets of Islam, alongside other prophets like\nMoses and Abraham. Muslims believe that Jesus was born of a virgin named Mary, and that He performed many\nmiracles during His lifetime.\nHowever, there are some fundamental differences between the Christian and Muslim beliefs about Jesus.\nMuslims do not believe that Jesus is the son of God or that He was crucified on the cross. According to Islamic\nteachings, Jesus was not crucified but rather God saved Him and raised Him to heaven before He could be\narrested.\nMuslims believe that Jesus will return to Earth before Judgment Day, and He will defeat the antichrist and\nestablish peace and justice on Earth. He is also believed to be a witness on the Day of Judgment.\nOverall, while Muslims do believe in Jesus, their beliefs about Him differ from those of Christians in important\nways. Muslims believe that Jesus was a prophet, but not the son of God, and that He did not die on the cross.\nThrough the teachings of the Quran and Islamic scripture, Muslims are encouraged to honor and respect Jesus,\nas they believe He was one of Allah's most important messengers.",

          "question": "60. Does one need to go to a mosque to convert?",
          "answer": "In order to convert to Islam, one does not necessarily need to go to a mosque. The process of converting\nprimarily involves the recitation of the shahada, or declaration of faith, in the presence of two Muslim witnesses.\nThis ritual can be performed anywhere and does not require the presence of an imam or an official religious\nauthority. However, mosques can provide valuable resources and support for individuals who are interested in\nconverting to Islam. Mosques typically offer educational classes, counseling services, and opportunities for\ncommunal worship and prayer. Additionally, being part of a mosque community can help new converts feel more\nconnected to their faith and facilitate their learning about Islamic traditions and practices. Ultimately, while going\nto a mosque is not necessary for converting to Islam, it can be beneficial for those seeking guidance and\ncommunity in their spiritual journey.\nReligion is often considered one of the most complex aspects of life. It not only provides a sense of community\nbut also impacts personal beliefs and ideologies. Several individuals contemplate changing their religion or faith,\ncommonly known as converting. Converting to a new religion is a significant decision that requires extensive\ncontemplation and research. One common question that arises during this process is whether one needs to go to\na mosque to convert to Islam. The answer to this question usually varies based on individual beliefs, thought\nprocess, and cultural background.\nTo begin with, it is essential to understand that Islam is a religion that believes in the practice of five pillars- belief\nin the oneness of God, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage. Conversion to Islam is a straightforward process\nthat only requires uttering the Shahada, the Islamic declaration of faith, which includes the statement of belief\nthat \"There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet.\" It is a simple declaration that signifies\nacceptance and commitment to the Islamic faith. Thus, one cannot emphasize the requirement of going to a\nmosque to utter or declare the Shahada.\nHowever, mosques play a significant role in the Islamic community as they represent a place of worship, social\ngathering, and education. Going to a mosque for the first time can add value to one's experience and\nunderstanding of Islamic practices. It provides an individual with a platform to interact with members of the\ncommunity and seek guidance from Islamic scholars. Moreover, attending a mosque can provide a sense of\nbelonging and togetherness among individuals who share the same faith.\nAdditionally, mosques can be a reliable source for information on Islamic beliefs and practices. Conversing with\nother community members and Islamic scholars can deepen one's understanding of Islam and clarify any\nmisconceptions or doubts. Mosques also offer various educational programs and classes for individuals wishing\nto learn more about Islam. These classes often cover topics such as Islamic history, culture, and traditions,\namong others.\nIn conclusion, there is no necessity for an individual to go to a mosque to convert to Islam. However, mosques\ndo offer invaluable benefits for individuals who seek guidance and assistance in understanding Islamic beliefs\nand practices. Mosque visits can provide a sense of community, offer access to educational programs, and\ndeepen one's understanding and appreciation of the Islamic faith. Ultimately, the decision to attend a mosque\nlies with the individual and should be based on their personal beliefs and goals.",

          "answer": "To attend prayers at a local mosque, start by researching the mosque's congregation and prayer times, which\nyou can find on the mosque's website or by calling them. It is important to dress modestly and respectfully in\nloose-fitted clothing that covers your arms, legs, and head for women. Upon arrival, seek out any signs or\nindications of gender separation within the prayer hall; there may be separate areas for men and women. Before\nentering the main hall, wash your hands up to the wrist, then rinse your mouth and nose in preparation for\nprayer. Ablution facilities are often available on-site for this purpose.

During the service, follow along with the\nImam's lead and stand when required; pray with proper etiquette like avoiding talking during Salah (prayer).\nAfterward, feel free to ask questions or stick around for any post-prayer gathering that follows tradition.\nGoing to a local mosque to pray is a sacred and spiritual experience that is cherished by millions of people\naround the world. For Muslims, visiting the mosque regularly is a way to connect with their faith, commune with\nthe community, and seek guidance and support from their fellow believers.

          "question": "62. Why do many Muslims kill innocents?",
          "answer": "it is not ethical for anyone to make any generalizations or assumptions about a particular group of people.\nHowever, it is widely known that Islam as a religion strictly forbids the killing of innocent people. Unfortunately,\nsome individuals or groups with political agendas have used distorted interpretations of religious texts to justify\ntheir violent actions against civilians. In addition, socioeconomic factors such as poverty, lack of education, and\npolitical instability can contribute to extremism and radicalization among certain Muslims. Ultimately, these\nindividuals who commit such heinous crimes do not represent the majority of Muslims worldwide who strive to\npromote peace and harmony in society. It is important for everyone to condemn terrorism and work towards\nbuilding a more peaceful world through education and dialogue.\nNo one can write such an essay which insightes terror or hatred, However, we would like to clarify that the\nassumption that many Muslims kill innocents is baseless, misleading, and contradicts the principle of Islam which\nprohibits killing innocent human beings. Islam is an Abrahamic religion which values human life and condemns\nany act of violence or terrorism that targets innocent people.\nFurthermore, it is important to understand that the actions of a few extremist groups or individuals do not reflect\nthe beliefs or practices of the entire Muslim population. Islamophobic propaganda and biased media coverage\noften portray an inaccurate and negative image of Muslims, resulting in harmful stereotypes and discrimination.\nIt is crucial to recognize that terrorism is a global issue that affects people of all religions and backgrounds. It is\nnot a problem exclusive to Muslims. Addressing the root causes of extremism, such as poverty, political\ninstability, and injustice, is essential in preventing acts of violence.\nIn conclusion, the notion that many Muslims kill innocents is unfounded and harmful. Instead, it is vital to\npromote peace, understanding, and respect between different religions and cultures. Only through empathy and\neducation can we defeat prejudice and violence.",

          "question": "63. Can a Muslim man marry 4 women?",
          "answer": "According to Islamic law, Muslim men are allowed to marry up to four wives at a time provided that they can treat\neach wife fairly and equally. This practice is known as polygamy and is often misunderstood by non-Muslims.\nThe Quran permits it in certain circumstances such as providing financial and emotional support for widows,\ndivorcees or women who may find it difficult to marry. However, Islam emphasizes the importance of treating all\nwives with equal care and affection, which includes providing them with adequate food, clothing, shelter along\nwith dividing their time among them fairly. Polygamy is not a requirement for Muslims nor is it encouraged if one\ncannot fulfill the responsibilities of marriage towards multiple partners. It should be mentioned that many Muslim\ncountries have banned this practice since it has been subject to abuse in some cases where men use it as an\nexcuse for coercive control over their wives rather than building respectful relationships based on love and\nmutual consent.\nIslamic law allows Muslim men to have up to four wives under certain conditions. This practice is known as\npolygyny and is a controversial issue in many societies. While some see it as a way to provide for more women\nand children, others view it as discriminatory and unfair to women.\nIn Islam, a man can only marry up to four women if he can provide for them equally. This means that he must\nhave the financial means, housing, and time to care for all of his wives and their children fairly. If a man cannot\nfulfill these requirements, he is not allowed to take on additional wives.\nFurthermore, the Quran states that a man should treat all of his wives with equal love and respect. He should not\nfavor one wife over another or treat one wife unfairly. If he is unable to do so, then he should not marry more than\none wife.\nPolygyny in Islam is not an obligation, but rather a permission granted by God under certain conditions. It is\nmeant to address situations where there is a shortage of men for various reasons, such as war or disease. In\nsuch circumstances, polygyny may benefit society by providing for the needs of more women and children who\nwould otherwise be left without support.\nHowever, polygyny can also be abused and can lead to problems such as jealousy, favoritism, and neglect. It is\ntherefore emphasized in Islam that a man should only take on additional wives if he can fulfill his responsibilities\nto all of them equally.\nIt is also important to note that polyandry, the practice of a woman having multiple husbands, is not allowed in\nIslam. This is because Islam places a strong emphasis on family and lineage, and it is necessary to know who\nthe father of a child is in order to establish inheritance rights and fulfill other obligations.\nIn conclusion, Muslim men are allowed to marry up to four women under certain conditions, including providing\nfor them equally and treating them with love and respect. Polygyny is not an obligation, but rather a permission\nthat is meant to address specific circumstances. However, it is important to ensure that this practice is not\nabused and that women are not treated unfairly.",

          "question": "64. What happens to me if I convert to islam?",
          "answer": "If you choose to convert to Islam, you will enter into a rich and diverse community of believers with over 1.5\nbillion adherents worldwide. The process of conversion involves making a declaration of faith, called the\nshahada, in which one testifies that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is his prophet. Afterward, it is\nrecommended to seek out a mosque or Islamic center for support and guidance from fellow Muslims. Living as a\nMuslim involves following the Five Pillars of Islam: witnessing that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad\nis his prophet; praying five times daily; giving to charity; fasting during Ramadan; and making the pilgrimage to\nMecca at least once in your lifetime if possible. Although converting may come with challenges such as familial\nor societal pressure, many who have done so report feeling spiritually fulfilled and connected to something larger\nthan themselves.\nIf an individual decides to convert to Islam, he or she can expect some significant changes. Firstly, he or she\nmust make a sincere declaration of faith in Allah and His prophets, particularly Prophet Muhammad (peace be\nupon him). The new Muslim will recite the Shahada, which is the declaration of faith, either in private or in the\npresence of a Muslim witness.\nAfter conversion, the new Muslim will be welcomed into the Muslim community, which is commonly called\nUmmah. They will be given a Muslim name and are no longer called by their original name, whichever religion\nthey followed before. The new Muslim will begin to practice the Five Pillars of Islam, which are the foundation of\nIslamic faith. These consist of the declaration of faith (Shahada), prayer (Salah), fasting during the month of\nRamadan (Sawm), giving Zakat (charity), and performing Hajj (pilgrimage) provided they have the resources.\nDue to conversion to Islam, the new Muslim must change his or her lifestyle regarding dress and behavior,\nparticularly regarding opposite genders. Women will wear the hijab and cover all parts of their bodies except\nfaces and hands. Men wear traditional Islamic clothing or their own choice of modest clothing. In Islam, it's\nprohibited to use vulgar language, consume alcohol or any drugs, and involve in adultery acts. Islam also lays\ndown ground rules for sexual relationships and restricts intimate relationships between any genders outside of\nmarriage.\nThe new Muslim will now participate in the Islamic calendar month and events, such as Eid al-Fitr and Eid\nal-Adha. He or she will be required to attend Islamic prayers every Friday, where they will listen to sermons and\noffer congregational prayers. The Muslim community encourages each other to follow these Islamic rules and\npractice their faith collectively.\nFinally, it's important to mention, Islam is a peaceful religion that doesn't promote terrorism or violence. Any\nterroristic or violent acts go against the fundamental teachings of Islam, and that person is guilty of the crime.\nIslam aims to promote peace, love, and harmony in society through its teachings, and a Muslim is expected to\nfollow them strictly.\nIn conclusion, conversion to Islam is an essential decision for an individual. It's important to research and\nunderstand the Islamic principles and customs before taking that step. One must be prepared to make significant\nchanges and live according to the Islamic way of life. If a person adheres to these teachings and practices it with\nhonesty, he or she will receive the love and support of the Islamic community and find peace, satisfaction, and\nhappiness in life.",

          "question": "5- Who is a Muslim?",
          "answer": "The word \"Muslim\" means one who submits to the\nwill of God. This is done by declaring that \"there is\nno god except one God and Muhammad is the\nmessenger of God.\" In a broader sense, anyone who\nwillingly submits to the will of God is a Muslim. Thus,\nall the prophets preceding the prophet Muhammad\nare considered Muslims. The Quran specifically\nmentions Abraham who lived long before Moses and\nChrist that, \"he was not a Jew or a Christian but a\nMuslim,\" because, he had submitted to the will of\nGod. Thus there are Muslims who are not submitting\nat all to the will of God and there are Muslims who\nare doing their best to live an Islamic life. One\ncannot judge Islam by looking at those individuals\nwho have a Muslim name but in their actions, they\nare not living or behaving as Muslims. The extent of\nbeing a Muslim can be according to the degree to\nwhich one is submitting to the will of God, in his\nbeliefs and his actions.\n6- Who was Muhammad? (Peace be upon him)\nIn brief, Muhammad (Peace be upon him) was born\nin a noble tribe of Mecca in Arabia in the year 570\nAD. His ancestry goes back to Prophet Ishmael\n(Peace be upon him), son of Prophet Abraham\n(Peace be upon him). His father died before his birth\n4\nand his mother died when he was six. He did not\nattend a formal school since he was raised first by a\nnurse as it was the custom those days, and then by\nhis grandfather and uncle. As a young man, he was\nknown as a righteous person who used to meditate\nin a cave. At age 40, he was given the prophethood\nwhen the angel, Gabriel, appeared in the cave.\nSubsequently, the revelations came over 23 years\nand were compiled in the form of a book called the\nQuran which Muslims consider as the final and the\nlast word of God. The Quran has been preserved,\nunchanged, in its original form and confirms the\ntruth in the Torah, the psalms and the Gospel. (1)\n7-How did Muhammad (peace be upon him)",

          "answer": "At the age of 40, while engaged in a meditative\nretreat, Muhammad (peace be upon him) received\nhis first revelation from God through the Angel\nGabriel. This revelation, which continued for twenty-\nthree years, is known as the Quran.\nAs soon as he began to recite the words he heard\nfrom Gabriel, and to preach the truth that God had\nrevealed to him, he and his small group of followers\nsuffered bitter persecution, which grew so fierce that\nin the year 622 God gave them the command to\nemigrate. This event, the Hijrah, 'migration', in\nwhich they left Makkah for the city of Madinah some\n260 miles to the north, marks the beginning of the\nMuslim calendar.\nAfter several years, the Prophet (peace be upon him)\nand his followers were able to return to Makkah,\nwhere they forgave their enemies and established\nIslam definitively. Before the Prophet (peace be\n5\nupon him) died at the age of 63, the greater part of\nArabia was Muslim, and within a century of his death\nIslam had spread to Spain in the West and as Far\nEast as China.\n8- Do Muslims worship Muhammad? (Peace be\nupon him)\nNo. Muslims do not worship Muhammad (Peace be\nupon him) or any other prophets. Muslims believe in\nall prophets including Adam, Noah, Abraham, David,\nSolomon, Moses and Jesus. Muslims believe that\nMuhammad (Peace be upon him) was the last of the\nprophets. They believe that God alone is to be\nworshiped, not any human being.\n___________________________\n1-Khan,The personality of Allah’s last messenger , p (17-\n34)",

          "answer": "Together with Judaism, they go back to the prophet\nand patriarch Abraham, and their three prophets are\ndirectly descended from his sons-Muhammad (peace\nbe upon him) from the eldest, Ishmael, and Moses\nand Jesus, from Isaac. Abraham established the\nsettlement, which today is the city of Makkah, and\nbuilt the Kabah towards which all Muslims turn when\nthey pray.\n15. What do Muslims think of Jesus? (Peace be\nupon him)\nMuslims think highly of Jesus (peace be upon him)\nand his worthy mother, Mary. The Quran tells us that\nJesus was born of a miraculous birth without a\nfather. \"Lo! The likeness of Jesus with Allah is the\n9\nlikeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then\nHe said unto him: Be and he is\" (Quran 3.59). He\nwas given many miracles as a prophet. These\ninclude speaking soon after his birth in defense of his\nmother's piety. God's other gifts to him included\nhealing the blind and the sick, reviving the dead,\nmaking a bird out of clay and most importantly, the\nmessage he was carrying. These miracles were given\nto him by God to establish him as a prophet.\nAccording to the Quran, he was not crucified but was\nraised into Heaven. (Quran, Chapter Maryam)\n16-\"How can you believe in God, when you\ncan't see, hear, touch, smell, taste or even\nimagine what He is?\"\nWe know from the teachings of Muhammad, peace\nbe upon him, that no one has ever actually seen God\n- at least not in this lifetime. Nor are we able to use\nour senses to make some kind of contact with Him.\nHowever, we are encouraged in Islam to use our\nsenses and our common sense to recognize that all\nof this universe could not possibly come into\nexistence on its own. Something had to design it all\nand then put it into motion. That is beyond our\nability to do, yet it is something that we can\nunderstand.\nWe don't have to see an artist to recognize a\npainting, correct? So, if we see paintings without\nseeing artists painting them, in the same way, we\ncan believe that Allah created everything without\nhaving to see Him (or touch, or hear, etc.).(1)\n10",

These pillars are 1) the belief (Iman)\nin one God and that Muhammad (P) is His\nmessenger, 2) prayer (Salat) which are prescribed\nfive times a day, 3) fasting (Siyam) which is required\nin the month of Ramadan, 4) charity (Zakat) which\nis the poor-due on the wealth of the rich and 5) hajj\nwhich is the pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime if\none can afford it physically and financially. All the\npillars should be of equal height and strength in a\nbuilding in order to give the building its due shape\nand proportions. It is not possible that one would do\nhajj without observing fasting or without practicing\nregular prayers. Now think of a building which has\npillars only. It would not be called a building. In\norder to make it a building, it has to have a roof, it\nhas to have walls, it has to have doors and windows.\nThese things in Islam are the moral codes of Islam\nsuch as honesty, truthfulness, steadfastness and\nmany other human moral qualities. Thus in order to\nbe a Muslim, one should not only be practicing the\npillars of Islam but should also have the highest\npossible attribute for being a good human being.\nOnly then the building is completed and looks\nbeautiful.",

To\nsay that Islam was spread by the sword would be to\nsay that Christianity was spread by guns, F-16's and\natomic bombs, etc., which is not true. Christianity\nspread by the missionary works of Christians. Ten-\npercent of all Arabs are Christians. The \"Sword of\nIslam\" could not convert all the non-Muslim\nminorities in Muslim countries.

A verse in the\nQuran says, [Chapter 5, verse 32], that \"anyone\nwho saves one life, it is as if he has saved the whole\nof mankind and anyone who has killed another\nperson (except in lieu of murder or mischief on\nearth) it is as if he has killed the whole of mankind.\"\nIslam condemns all the violence which happened in\nthe Crusades, in Spain, in WW II, or by acts of\npeople like the Rev. Jim Jones, David Koresh, Dr.\nBaruch Goldstein, or the atrocities committed in\nBosnia by the Christian Serbs. Anyone who is doing\nviolence is not practicing his religion at that time.\nHowever, sometimes violence is a human response\nof oppressed people as it happens in Palestine.\nAlthough this is wrong, they think of this as a way to\n15\nget attention. There is a lot of terrorism and violence\nin areas where there is no Muslim presence. For\nexample, in Ireland, South Africa, Latin America, and\nSri Lanka. Sometimes the violence is due to a\nstruggle between those who have with those who do\nnot have, or between those who are oppressed with\nthose who are oppressors. We need to find out why\npeople become terrorists. Unfortunately, the\nPalestinians who are doing violence are called\nterrorists, but not the armed Israeli settlers when\nthey do the same sometimes even against their own\npeople. As it turned out to be in the Oklahoma City\nbombing, sometime Muslims are prematurely blamed\neven if the terrorism is committed by non-Muslims.\nSometimes those who want Peace and those who\noppose Peace can be of the same religion.",

          "answer": "No, polygamy in Islam is a permission not an\ninjunction. Historically, all the prophets except Jesus,\nwho was not married, had more than one wife. For\nMuslim men to have more than one wife is a\npermission which is given to them in the Quran, not\nto satisfy lust, but for the welfare of the widows and\nthe orphans of the wars. In the pre-Islamic period,\nmen used to have many wives. One person had 11\nwives and when he became Muslim, he asked the\nProphet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), \"What\nshould I do with so many wives?\" and he said,\n\"Divorce all except the four.\" The Quran says, \"you\ncan marry 2 or 3 and up to 4 women if you can be\nequally just with each of them\" (4:3). Since it is very\ndifficult to be equally just with all wives, in practice,\nmost of the Muslim men do not have more than one\nwife. Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him)\nhimself from age 24 to 50 was married to only one\nwoman, Khadija. In the western society, some men\nwho have one wife have many extramarital affairs.\nThus, a survey was published in \"U.S.A. Today\"\n(April 4, 1988 Section D) which asked 4,700\nmistresses what they would like their status to be.\nThey said that \"they preferred being a second wife\nrather than the 'other woman' because they did not\nhave the legal rights, nor did they have the financial\n17\nequality of the legally married wives, and it appeared\nthat they were being used by these men.\"",

Jews\nwere welcomed and flourished in Muslim Spain even\nwhen they were persecuted in the rest of Europe.\nThey consider that part of their history as the Golden\nEra. In Muslim countries, Christians live in\n18\nprosperity, hold government positions and attend\ntheir church. However, the same religious tolerance\nis not always available to Muslim minorities as seen\nin the past during Spanish inquisition and the\ncrusades, or as seen now by the events in Bosnia,\nIsrael and India.

          "answer": "In the Islamic world there are no old people’s\nhomes. The strain of caring for one’s parents in this\nmost difficult time of their lives is considered an\nhonor and blessing, and an opportunity for great\nspiritual growth. God asks that we not only pray for\nour parents, but act with limitless\n21\ncompassion, remembering that when we were\nhelpless children they preferred us to themselves.\nMothers are particularly honored: the Prophet (Peace\nbe upon him) taught that ‘Paradise lies at the feet of\nmothers’.\nWhen they reach old age, Muslim parents are treated\nmercifully, with the same kindness and selflessness.\nIn Islam, serving one’s parents is a duty second only\nto prayer, and it is their right to expect it.\nThe Qur’an says: ‘Your Lord has commanded that\nyou worship none but Him, and be kind to parents.\nIf either or both of them reach old age with you, do\nnot say ‘Uff’ to them or chide them, but speak\nto them in terms of honor and kindness. Treat them\nwith humility, and say, ‘My Lord! Have mercy\non them, for they cared for me when I was little’.\n(17:23-4)",

          "answer": "Although much simpler than the dietary law\nfollowed by Jews and the early Christians, the\ncode which Muslims observe forbids the\nconsumption of pig meat or any kind of\nintoxicating drink. The Prophet Muhammad (peace\nbe upon him) taught that 'your body has rights\nover you', and the consumption of wholesome\nfood and the leading of a healthy lifestyle are\nseen as religious obligations. The Prophet (peace\nbe upon him) said: 'Ask God for certainty [of\nfaith] and well-being; for after certainty, no one is\ngiven any gift better than health!'\n22",

There are two declarations, which\nare necessary:\n1- To bear witness that no one deserves to be\nworshiped except Allah.\n2- To bear witness that Prophet Muhammad (peace\nbe upon him) is the Messenger of Allah.\nThis makes a person Muslim.
